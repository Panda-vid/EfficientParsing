# EfficientParsing
Semantic parser for spreadsheet applications which is able to generalize new instances by decomposition.   
Main project of a bachelors thesis in computer science. 

## Requirements:
- Python 3.10
- Java version 11 or newer
- Ubuntu or Windows Subsystem for Linux

## Cloning the project:
To clone this project you require Git LFS. 
An installation guide can be found [here](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation).

## Installation:
To use this project, we recommend creating a python virtual environment.  
To create the environment copy the following inside the terminal in the project base folder ```./setup_venv.sh```. 
The script will ask for your ```sudo``` password and should install all required python modules as well as 
do the required setup work for you. 

## Usage:
Under ```notebooks```, you can experiment with components of the semantic parser and see usage examples.  
Furthermore, you can create plots which contain information about the quality of certain aspects of the semantic parser.  
  
In addition, you can use ```do_measurements.py``` in ```efficient_parsing``` to compute the measurements done in the 
[bachelor thesis](thesis.pdf).  You can execute a single measurement or all at once.   
The results of the measurement are saved in ```res/measurements``` where each measurement will have a folder containing 
all mistranslated instances and the accuracies after each test in ```.csv```-files.  
Refer to the help text of the script for further information on the usage and to the thesis for more information 
on the configurations.

## Documentation:
You can create autogenerated docs by executing:  
```sphinx-build -b html source/ build/html```
in the ```/docs``` folder inside the virtual environment.  

You can then open the ```index.html``` file under ```docs/build/html``` with a browser of your choice.
