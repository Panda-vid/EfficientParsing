Several bomb explosions in Afghanistan, blamed on Taleban insurgents, have
killed four American troops and two Afghan policemen, and wounded two U.S.
Embassy officials.
A roadside bomb in southern Zabul province killed the four soldiers and wounded
three others early Sunday. A U.S. commander, Major-General Jason Kamiya, said
the blast would not weaken the resolve of coalition forces.
In another part of the province, two Afghan policemen were killed in a similar
blast.
Meanwhile, in the western outskirts of Kabul, a roadside bomb exploded near a
convoy of U.S. Embassy vehicles, slightly wounding two officials.
In the southern province of Kandahar, gunmen on motorcycles killed a pro-
government cleric, while in the eastern province of Kunar, rebels ambushed two
tankers supplying fuel to U.S. military base.
