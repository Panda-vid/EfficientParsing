Russia's upper house of parliament has approved President Vladimir Putin's
controversial plan to end direct elections to choose regional governors, and
allow the Kremlin to appoint them instead.
The Federation Council adopted the measure Wednesday by 145 votes to one, with
two abstentions. It now goes to the Kremlin to become law with Mr. Putin's
signature.
The president says such changes are necessary to block terrorists from trying
to influence Russia's local elections. But critics across the political
spectrum say the plan is a step back from democracy.
Under the new law, the Kremlin would select gubernatorial candidates, whose
appointments would require confirmation by regional lawmakers. If a provincial
parliament rejects a governor chosen by Moscow, the new law says Mr. Putin has
the authority to dissolve that legislature.
