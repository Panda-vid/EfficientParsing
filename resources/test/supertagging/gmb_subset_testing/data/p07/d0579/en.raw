Authorities in Indian Kashmir say at least 15 people died when a bus veered off
a steep mountain road and plunged into a gorge.
Reports from the area Wednesday say at least 15 other people on the bus were
injured but survived the accident.
Survivors' accounts indicate the driver lost control of the bus on a sharp
curve, and the vehicle plunged 250 meters down a mountainside. Villagers and
police used ropes to reach the wreck.
The bus had been traveling through the Tajouri district, nearly 200 kilometers
northwest of Jammu city, Indian Kashmir's winter capital.
