Pakistani officials say Sunni and Shi'ite militants are battling each other for
a third day in the country's North-West Frontier Province.
A Pakistani administrator in the tribal region, Sahibzada Mohammed Anis, says
the confirmed death toll from the fighting is 15, with scores of people
wounded. On Saturday, another official said 40 people had been killed.
The administrator says tribal elders are trying to negotiate an end to the
violence.
Heavy fighting between majority Sunnis and minority Shi'ites erupted Friday in
and around the town of Parachinar in the semi-autonomous Kurram region.
Pakistani officials say the fighting in Parachinar subsided Saturday after the
military imposed a curfew and government helicopters patrolled the area. But,
they say battles continued Sunday in nearby villages.
The cause of the sectarian violence has not been independently confirmed, but
residents say it began after one group held a demonstration denouncing the
other sect.
