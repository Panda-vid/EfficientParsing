The U.S. space agency NASA is counting down toward a nighttime launch of the
space shuttle Endeavouron a 16-day mission to the International Space Station.
The shuttle is scheduled to launch early Tuesday morning with seven astronauts
and some high-tech freight on board.
Endeavour will deliver the first module of a Japanese space laboratory and a
Canadian robot designed to handle some of the jobs performed by spacewalking
astronauts.
The Japanese lab is called Kibo, a Japanese word for hope. If shuttle flights
go according to schedule, its final module should be delivered next year to the
space station.
The Canadian robot, called Dextre, can be operated by the crew inside the
station or by flight controllers on the ground.
Astronauts intend to perform five spacewalks during their stay at the space
station. The 16-day mission will be the longest shuttle mission to the space
station to date.
