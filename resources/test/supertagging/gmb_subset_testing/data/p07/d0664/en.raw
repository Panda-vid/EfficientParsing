Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi launched his political campaign
Saturday for the snap general election he has called on September 11.
The prime minister says the focal point of the election will be his proposal
for privatization of Japan's national postal system, a sprawling business
empire that includes savings institutions with three trillion dollars in
assets.
Mr. Koizumi dissolved Parliament and called a general election about two weeks
ago after Japan's upper house voted down postal reforms - with members of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party joining the majority. LDP leaders have
withdrawn support for lawmakers who voted "no" on August 8, and say they will
not be allowed to run for re-election.
A Yomiuri newspaper poll this week shows support for Mr. Koizumi has risen to
53.2 percent, up 5.5 percentage points since he dissolved Parliament.
