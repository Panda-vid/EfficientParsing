The moderate faction of Indian Kashmir's main political separatist alliance
says it will urge Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to include them in talks
with India on the future of the divided region.
The chairman of the alliance, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, says he intends to tell
General Musharraf that the Kashmir dispute cannot be solved without the
inclusion of Kashmiris.
The Pakistani leader is due to meet the separatists in New Delhi during a visit
Sunday to watch an India-Pakistan cricket match.
The two South Asian nuclear rivals have twice gone to war over Kashmir since
they gained independence from Britain. But their relations have improved since
the launch of a peace process last year.
The process received a boost last week when the two sides re-opened a historic
bus route across the military line-of-control for the first time in nearly 60
years.
