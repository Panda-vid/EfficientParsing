Peruvian officials say they will not free a U.S. woman serving a 20-year
sentence for terrorist collaboration, even if a regional human rights court
orders her release.
Foreign Minister Manuel Rodriguez said Saturday if the Inter-American Court of
Human Rights orders Lori Berenson's release, Peru would refuse.
The Costa Rica-based court is set to discuss the case this coming week.
Berenson was arrested in 1995 and accused of involvement in a failed attempt by
the rebel Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement to seize Peru's Congress.
A military court initially convicted and sentenced Berenson to life in prison
for treason.
That sentence was overturned and she was re-tried by a civilian court. She was
acquitted of being an active member of the rebel group but convicted of helping
the guerrillas plan the attack on the Congress.
Berenson has maintained her innocence.
