Israel says it has launched fresh airstrikes against Palestinian militant
targets in the Gaza Strip.
Army officials say Israeli aircraft attacked at least eight roads and bridges
Sunday leading to sites used by militants to launch rockets into Israeli
territory.  It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties.
On Saturday, Palestinian officials said a Palestinian militant was killed and
three others wounded in an explosion in the Gaza Strip.  Security officials
said Israeli aircraft fired a missile at a car carrying the militant (said to
be a member of the Abu Rish Brigades).  Israel denied the report.
