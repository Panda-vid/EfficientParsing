A meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Middle
East envoy George Mitchell has been postponed so the two sides have more time
to prepare.

The Israeli prime minister was due to meet with Mitchell in Paris, France,
Thursday, but an Israeli official said his side is seeking to conduct "more
professional work" on the issues before the meeting.  Israeli Defense Minister
Ehud Barack is expected to meet Mitchell instead in Washington next week.

Officials close to Mr. Netanyahu denied Israeli media reports that the meeting
was called off because of a disagreement over Israeli settlement activity.

The United States has said Israel must halt settlement expansion in the
occupied West Bank as part of a comprehensive peace plan.  

Israel has resisted the notion, saying some degree of expansion must continue
to support the natural growth of settler communities.
