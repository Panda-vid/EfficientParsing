Former Czech President Vaclav Havel has delivered a letter to the Belarus
Embassy in Prague, calling on Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko to step
down.
Mr. Havel says he was denied entry to the building Tuesday and left the letter
in the embassy's mailbox.
He said the letter was meant as an act of solidarity with those in Belarus
struggling for more freedom. He added that the Czech people know the importance
of such solidarity.
Mr. Havel also called on European Union countries to, in his words, resist evil
from the very beginning and not wait for what he called "catastrophic
consequences."
