The U.S. national security advisor says Pakistan, Afghanistan and the United
States have to cooperate more closely if they are to stem the threat posed by
terrorists operating in Pakistan's border areas.
Stephen Hadley made the comment at a news conference in Kabul, following a
meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
Mr. Hadley said Washington is working very closely with both Pakistan and
Afghanistan to counter the threat. But, he said, this is a very hard problem
and there is no quick fix.
The U.S. official stressed the only way to successfully counter the threat is
to learn to work effectively together. He said that although all three nations
had made progress, they have a responsibility to do a lot more.
