Signs are mounting that the dominant Fatah faction of Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas may consider delaying key parliamentary elections scheduled for
July.
The issue has emerged one month after the militant Palestinian Islamic group
Hamas announced that it would end a nearly decade-long boycott and participate
in the July elections.
Palestinian lawmakers say the election may be delayed because a modified
election law may not be adopted in time.
But other officials say parliamentary leaders want to delay the vote for fear
Hamas, which has gained considerable public support, would undercut Fatah's
power in parliament.
Hamas emerged as a key player in Palestinian politics after winning an
overwhelming victory in its Gaza Strip strongholds in January's municipal
elections.
