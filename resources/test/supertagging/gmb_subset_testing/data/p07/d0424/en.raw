Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov says the government is cutting its
troops in Chechnya by 1,000.
Mr. Ivanov made the announcement Friday at a military installation in the
southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don.  He gave no reason for the action.
The Itar-Tass news agency says airborne troops and marine units in the
mountainous regions of Chechnya will be withdrawn.
Mr. Ivanov says the only forces that will remain next year in the war-torn
breakaway republic will be an infantry division and Defense Ministry commando
forces.
Russia has been fighting separatists in Chechnya for most of the past decade,
in a conflict that has devastated the region.  President Vladimir Putin has
repeatedly said the fighting is dying down, but the violence continues.
