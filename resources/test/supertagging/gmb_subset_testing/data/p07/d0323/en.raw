Staff from Arabic television station al-Jazeera protested Thursday around the
Middle East in the wake of a British news report that alleged President Bush
considered bombing the channel's headquarters last year.
Dozens of al-Jazeera reporters and staff members demonstrated outside the
station's headquarters in Doha, Qatar and in other cities. They called for an
investigation into the allegations raised in the Daily Mirror article, which
was based on an allegedly leaked official memorandum.
In Cairo, Beirut and Gaza City, al-Jazeera staffers were joined by colleagues
from other Arab media.
The White House has dismissed the tabloid report as "outlandish and
inconceivable."
After its front-page story Tuesday, the Daily Mirror and two other British
papers said Britain's government threatened them with legal action if they
publish further details of the top secret document.
