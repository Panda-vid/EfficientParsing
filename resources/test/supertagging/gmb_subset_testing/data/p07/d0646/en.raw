Zimbabwe is preparing to nullify thousands of legal challenges by white farmers
who had their land seized under the country's controversial land reform
program.
A report in Zimbabwe's Sunday Mail newspaper says authorities will file court
papers Monday to officially end the litigation under a new constitutional
amendment that nationalizes all seized farms and bans any legal challenges.
An official in the attorney general's office says 4,000 cases pending before
the courts will be nullified.
President Robert Mugabe began the land seizures in 2000 and transferred
ownership to landless blacks.  Mr. Mugabe says the land seizures were necessary
to correct ownership imbalances created under British colonial rule.  But
critics say the program has been a failure and has led to the collapse of
Zimbabwe's economy.
