Macedonia's delegation says it is leaving the NATO summit in Bucharest early to
protest the alliance's failure to invite it to begin membership talks because
of a dispute over the country's name.
Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki told reporters in the Romanian capital that
the Macedonian delegation will leave shortly after a meeting with U.S.
President George W. Bush.
The Macedonian News Agency (MIA) reports that President Branko Crvenkovski and
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski have canceled all other meetings scheduled for
later Thursday and Friday.
NATO leaders said Macedonia fulfilled requirements for a membership, but held
off extending the invitation after Greece threatened a veto.
Greece demands that Macedonia change its name, which is the same as the name of
a northern Greek province. Greece contends that the former Yugoslav republic's
refusal to change its name implies territorial claims, a charge Macedonia
denies.
