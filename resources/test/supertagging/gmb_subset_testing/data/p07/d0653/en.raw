A court in Venezuela has ordered four people detained for their alleged
involvement in the assassination of a leading government prosecutor.
Those ordered held by the court Friday include newspaper editor Patricia Poleo
and businessman Nelson Mezerhane.
They are accused of plotting the assassination of Danilo Anderson, who was
leading the prosecution of hundreds of people accused of backing a 2002 coup
against President Hugo Chavez.
Mr. Anderson was killed by a car bomb last November. Ms. Poleo and Mr.
Mezerhane are accused of plotting the assassination with two others who have
been detained - retired general Eugenio Anez Nunez and Salvador Romani, a Cuban
dissident.
Since Mr. Anderson's killing last year, Venezuelan police have arrested at
least two other suspects, while two others were killed in a gunfight with
police.
