Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party has selected Roberto Madrazo as its
candidate for the 2006 presidential election.
Mr. Madrazo easily defeated challenger Everado Moreno during Sunday's PRI
primary election.
Mr. Madrazo is a former Tobasco state governor who headed the PRI until
recently. His nomination was virtually assured after his main challenger Arturo
Montiel dropped out last month amid allegations of corruption.
The presidential primary is the party first since it was defeated by President
Vicente Fox and his National Action Party in 2000 after the PRI held power for
seven decades. During that time, Mexican presidents handpicked their successors
in the party.
With conservative president Fox not allowed to run again, Mr. Madrazo will face
conservative Felipe Calderon and leftist Andres Manual Lopez Obrador in next
July's election. Mr. Obrador is currently leading most opinion polls.
