A 15-member U.N. Security Council delegation is in Haiti to assess the work of
peacekeepers trying to stabilize the country following last year's ouster of
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Brazilian Ambassador Ronaldo Sardenberg is leading the delegation, which
arrived in Port-au-Prince Wednesday for the four-day visit.
The fact-finding trip comes at a time when the Security Council is preparing to
vote on extending the mandate of the U.N. peacekeeping force in the country,
which expires at the end of May.
U.N. peacekeepers and the interim government have been struggling to contain
violence in Haiti since Mr. Aristide was removed from power in February 2004.
Mr. Sardenberg has described the situation in the country as "dire."
