%%% U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy , a Democratic Party leader who is suffering from brain cancer , has returned to Washington to work on the issue of health care reform . Senator Kennedy released a statement Monday , saying he would lay the groundwork for early action by Congress on health reform after President-elect Barack Obama takes office in January . Kennedy also said he was grateful for the prayers and good wishes he has received in recent months . The Massachusetts senator , who was first elected in 1962 , underwent surgery in June for a malignant brain tumor . He made a brief appearance in the Senate in July , and delivered a speech supporting Mr. Obama at the Democratic National Convention in August . Two of his brothers , President John F. Kennedy and Senator Robert Kennedy , were assassinated in the 1960s . Another brother , Joseph Kennedy , was killed while serving in World War II .
