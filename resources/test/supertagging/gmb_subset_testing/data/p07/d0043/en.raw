U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy, a Democratic Party leader who is suffering from
brain cancer, has returned to Washington to work on the issue of health care
reform.

Senator Kennedy released a statement Monday, saying he would lay the groundwork
for early action by Congress on health reform after President-elect Barack
Obama takes office in January.

Kennedy also said he was grateful for the prayers and good wishes he has
received in recent months.

The Massachusetts senator, who was first elected in 1962, underwent surgery in
June for a malignant brain tumor. He made a brief appearance in the Senate in
July, and delivered a speech supporting Mr. Obama at the Democratic National
Convention in August.

Two of his brothers, President John F. Kennedy and Senator Robert Kennedy, were
assassinated in the 1960s. Another brother, Joseph Kennedy, was killed while
serving in World War II.Â
