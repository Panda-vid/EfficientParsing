The foreign relations committee of Pakistan's upper house of parliament has
condemned what it called the Israeli "aggression" on Lebanon and urged the
international community to pressure the Jewish state to halt the strikes.
  
The demand came through a unanimously adopted resolution at a special session
of the Senate committee held in Islamabad.  Pakistan has no diplomatic
relations with Israel.
Some 800 Pakistani students staged demonstrations in the southern port city of
Karachi to protest against the Israeli action.
  
In neighboring Bangladesh, Foreign Minister M. Morshed Khan urged Western
countries "to restrain Israel" from such attacks and said many Western
countries use a double standard in dealing with the Middle East.
