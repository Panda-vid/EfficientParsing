%%% Authorities in Belarus have detained several key members of the campaign staff of opposition presidential candidate Alexander Milinkevich . The detentions came after the candidate held a rally outside a movie theater in the capital , Minsk , ahead of the country 's March 19 presidential election . The opposition website , Charter97 identifies one of those detained as Vintsuk Vyachorka , leader of the Belarus Popular Front . The website says other campaign workers had no information about the detainees for several hours , but then learned they had been taken to a Minsk prison . The incident is the latest instance of harassment of candidates challenging President Alexander Lukashenko in the election . Mr. Lukashenko has ruled the former Soviet republic since 1994 , and is seeking a third term . The West has criticized him for his poor human rights record and for quashing political opposition . The United States has called him Europe 's last dictator .
