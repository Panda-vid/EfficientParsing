Police in northwest Pakistan say suspected Taliban militants have blown up a
primary school that educated girls.

Officials say there were no casualties in Tuesday's blast because the school
was closed for the Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the Muslim holy month
of Ramadan.

Al-Qaida and Taliban-linked militants who oppose the education of women have
destroyed hundreds of girls schools across the country.

On Monday, police killed a suicide bomber trying to assassinate a regional
education minister, also in the northwest.

In other violence, Pakistani security forces say they have arrested 11
suspected militants, including three Afghanis, during security operations in
Malakand and Swat districts.

In a statement released Tuesday, officials say they also found four inter-
linked tunnels and bomb-proof bunkers during a separate search operation near
Swat's Biakand area.
