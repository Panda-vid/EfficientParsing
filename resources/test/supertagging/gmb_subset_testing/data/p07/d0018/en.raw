The government of Afghanistan says reprimands of U.S. soldiers involved in
burning the bodies of two dead Taleban insurgents is a very lenient punishment.
The U.S. military said Saturday that the soldiers will face disciplinary action
over the incident, but will not be prosecuted.
It said an investigation concluded the troops burned the bodies for hygienic
purposes, but that junior officers who ordered the cremation will be
reprimanded for showing a lack of cultural and religious understanding.
The Afghan Foreign Ministry said that whatever the purpose and the reason, the
burning of human bodies is unacceptable to Islam and local traditions, and by
no means should be repeated.
News of the incident surfaced last month when an Australian television channel
aired a video purportedly showing the American soldiers burning the bodies of
two militants they had killed near Kandahar.
