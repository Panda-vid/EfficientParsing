The United States says it is being forced to suspend food aid to North Korea
because of Pyongyang's decision to stop allowing the United Nations to
distribute the food.
State Department spokesman Adam Ereli said Thursday U.S. policy requires that
international relief workers be able to monitor the distribution of its food.
That safeguard will disappear when the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) stops
distributing food in North Korea this month.
Mr. Ereli said it is a common practice for North Korea to "ignore the needs of
its people" and "let them starve for inexplicable reasons."
North Korea announced in August that it no longer wanted U.N. food aid because
it said domestic food production had improved.
The WFP said it would close all its food-processing plants in North Korea by
the end of this month.
