More than 100 countries with delegates at a global conference on racism have
agreed on a declaration calling for an end to intolerance and xenophobia.

The declaration, adopted Tuesday in Geneva, reaffirms a 2001 statement issued
at the first United Nations conference on racism in Durban, South Africa.

The decision Tuesday by consensus came a day after Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad stirred controversy with an address in which he described Israel as
"cruel, repressive and racist."  Mr. Ahmadinejad's address sparked a walkout by
delegates from 23 European Union nations.

The United States and eight other Western countries boycotted the conference
over fears that it would become a forum for anti-Semitism.

U.N. and Western diplomats criticized the Iranian president's remarks as
outrageous, anti-Semitic and an incitement to hatred.  U.N. Secretary-General
Ban Ki-moon said the Iranian leader used the meeting "to accuse, divide and
even incite."
