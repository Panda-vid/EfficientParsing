Hundreds of protesters in Russia's republic of Ingushetia have demanded the
resignation of its president.
A heavy security presence shadowed Monday's rally in the city of Nazran as
protesters called for the resignation of President Murat Zyazikov, a former KGB
general who was elected in 2002 with significant Kremlin support.
Police in the predominantly Muslim republic reportedly arrested one of the
protest organizers, Boris Arsamokov.
The Associated Press reports that participants also demanded the Kremlin redraw
the boundary between Ingushetia and North Ossetia to return territory that
belonged to ethnic Ingush. 
North Ossetia is a neighboring republic dominated by Orthodox
Christians.  Ingushetia also borders Chechnya, where separatists have fought
pro-Moscow forces for more than five years.
