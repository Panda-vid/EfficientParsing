A U.S. government oversight agency says Afghanistan's reconstruction program
has no coherent spending strategy to implement its goals.

A report by the U.S. Congress's Special Inspector General for Afghanistan
Reconstruction released late Thursday says the U.S. has appropriated, but not
fully spent, $32 billion for humanitarian aid in the country, while other
nations have donated $25 billion. 

The report found that reconstruction efforts have been fragmented and lack a
central plan to complete U.S. goals.  Those goals include rebuilding Afghan
infrastructure, re-establishing political institutions, providing services to
the Afghan people, and maintaining security necessary for reconstruction
projects.

The report also says government officials in Afghanistan want a greater say in
building plans.

Congress created the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan
Reconstruction under the authority of the National Defense Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year 2008.  The measure was signed into law one year ago.
