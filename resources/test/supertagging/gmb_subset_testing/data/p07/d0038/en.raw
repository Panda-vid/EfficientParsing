Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko is warning parliament not to hold a
planned opening of its fall session Tuesday, saying any decisions it makes will
be illegitimate.
Mr. Yushchenko said in a nationwide television address Monday that under the
constitution, the parliament would have no authority.
He called the opposition members provocateurs and said their plan to hold an
opening session is an attempt to derail parliamentary elections later this
month.
Mr. Yushchenko dissolved parliament in March, accusing his chief political
opponent, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, of illegally enticing Yushchenko
supporters to join the opposition.
The lawmakers refused to dissolve and many still say their parliament still
exists.
The president and prime minister agreed to hold early general elections on
September 30.
