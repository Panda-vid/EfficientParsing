Junoon means "obsession" in the Urdu language.  It is the name of one of
Pakistan's and perhaps South Asia's most popular rock bands. The group is based
in Karachi, and was formed in 1990 by guitarist, songwriter and medical doctor
Salman Ahmad. Sometimes when Junoon performs in the United States, an American-
based singer of Indian origin, known as Falu, opens for the group. VOA's Ravi
Khanna brings us a glimpse of Falu's life and music, based on an interview by
VOA's Ethnomusicologist, Brian Q. Silver.
