Danish police are holding seven people suspected of planning terrorist attacks
in the Scandinavian country.
Authorities say security police launched a raid early Tuesday and detained nine
suspects in Vollsmose, a mostly immigrant neighborhood in the city of Odense. 
Police released two of the suspects.
Justice Minister Lene Espersen said police seized materials used to make
explosives, and she said most of the suspects are thought to be Danish citizens
of foreign origin. 
Espersen declined to disclose further details but she said evidence showed the
group had been plotting to stage an attack somewhere in Denmark.
Last month, authorities charged four suspects with trying to obtain explosives
to carry out a terrorist attack.
Also in early August, a Moroccan-born Dane was charged with inciting Muslims to
carry out terrorist acts.
