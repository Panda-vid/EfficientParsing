A published report says U.S. military officials in Iraq knew that American
forces were abusing detainees throughout that country, more than a month before
mistreatment at the Abu Ghraib prison was uncovered.
The Washington Post newspaper Wednesday, says a confidential report about the
abuse was given to Army generals in Iraq in December 2003, before military
investigators received photographs of the abuses at Abu Ghraib. That Abu Ghraib
scandal became public several months later when news media published
photographs of the abuse.
The Postsays the confidential report was written by retired Colonel Stuart
Herrington. He disclosed that members of a special joint military and Central
Intelligence Agency task force TF-121 were abusing detainees throughout Iraq
and using a secret interrogation facility to hide their activities.
A Pentagon official told the Post the Herrington report was taken very
seriously, and that its findings were passed on to U.S. Central Command.
