Pakistan and India have ushered in the new year by exchanging lists of their
civilian nuclear facilities.
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry Tuesday said the two countries participated in the
annual exchange, as part of a 1998 agreement prohibiting attacks on each
other's nuclear installations.
The lists of nuclear facilities were handed over at India and Pakistan's
respective foreign ministries in New Delhi and Islamabad.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since partition in 1947. But
relations have improved since the two countries launched a slow moving peace
process in 2004 to resolve their disputes, including the conflict over Kashmir.
India and Pakistan both conducted nuclear weapons tests in 1998.
