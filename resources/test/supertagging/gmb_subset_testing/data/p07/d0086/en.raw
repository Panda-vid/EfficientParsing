Burmese activists have gathered outside the Russian Embassy in Malaysia to call
on Moscow to end its support for building a nuclear research center in Burma.
Some 50 protesters took part in the demonstration Tuesday.
In May, Russia announced that it had agreed to help build a nuclear research
center in Burma.
The United States has expressed concern about the deal, saying Burma does not
have the regulatory or safety provisions to successfully handle that type of
nuclear program.
Russia and China have become major suppliers of arms to Burma since the West
imposed sanctions in 1988 over Burma's poor human rights record.
