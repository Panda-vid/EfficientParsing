U.S. lawmaker Connie Mack says Arabic-language al-Jazeera television, which has
allied with Latin America's Telesur network, is nothing more than a mouthpiece
for terrorists.
The Republican congressman from the southeastern U.S. state of Florida tells
VOA he is very concerned about that alliance. Earlier, he said it would create
a global network for terrorists and other enemies of freedom. He is calling for
Congress to pass a plan authorizing the U.S. government to begin radio and
television broadcasts into Venezuela.
Thursday, Venezuela's Communications Ministry said Congressman Mack's comments
represent a veiled threat that the United States will attack Telesur's
headquarters in Caracas.
A spokesman for the State Department said Friday it is not up to the U.S.
government to dictate what sort of business deals media organizations can make.
