The United States is temporarily closing its consulate in the Mexican border
city of Nuevo Laredo because of escalating violence.
In a statement from Mexico City Friday, Ambassador Tony Garza said the
consulate will close for one week, beginning August 1.  He says Thursday's
battle on the streets of Nuevo Laredo forced the closure to assess the security
situation for employees and travelers.
Rival gangs clashed with machine guns, grenades and a rocket launcher late
Thursday.  No one was killed, but the neighborhood has been described as
resembling a war zone.
The closure announcement comes days after the ambassador asked the U.S. State
Department to extend its travel advisory warning Americans about attacks in
Mexico.
More than 100 people have been killed in the town since June, including 18
policemen, as gangs compete for drug-smuggling routes into the United States.
