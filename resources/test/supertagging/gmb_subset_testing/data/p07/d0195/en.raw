Pakistan has agreed to allow Indian diplomats to visit a jailed Indian man who
was sentenced to death for spying.
A spokesman for Pakistan's foreign ministry said Friday, that officials for the
two countries will work out a date for the visit.
India has been pressing its neighbor for access to the man, Sarabjit Singh,
whose 1991 conviction on spying and involvement in a series of bombings was
upheld last week by Pakistan's Supreme Court.
Singh's family denies the charges, saying he is a farmer who accidentally
strayed onto Pakistani soil 15 years ago.
The Indian government has been pressing Pakistan to spare the man's life.
