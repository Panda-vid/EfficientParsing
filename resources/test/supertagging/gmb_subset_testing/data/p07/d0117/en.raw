Vietnamese health officials say a woman in the north of the country has died
from bird flu as a new outbreak is reported in southern China.
The director of Vietnam's preventive medicine department, Nguyen Huy Nga, said
the 23-year-old teacher died Monday after testing positive for H5N1 strain of
avian influenza.
Her death brings the number of people in Vietnam killed by the virus to 50, out
of 105 total human infections.
In separate news, Chinese health officials Monday reported a new outbreak in
the southern province of Guizhou. Authorities said nearly 4,000 poultry have
died from the disease and a further 238,000 have been culled.
China earlier announced the death in Guangdong province of a 44-year-old woman
- the country's 19th fatality and the third this year.
