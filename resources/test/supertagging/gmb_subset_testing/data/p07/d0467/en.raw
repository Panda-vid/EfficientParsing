NATO has acknowledged responsibility for killing 12 Afghan civilians during a
major U.S.-led offensive against the Taliban in southern Afghanistan.

NATO says the civilians were killed when two rockets fired at insurgents missed
their intended target.  Afghan President Hamid Karzai expressed sadness at the
incident.  He has ordered an investigation into the deaths in the Nad Ali
district.

The large-scale military operation began early Saturday, concentrated on the
farming community of Marjah in southern Helmand province.

Some 15,000 U.S., British and Afghan soldiers are involved in the offensive,
designed to oust the Taliban from an area that has been an insurgent
stronghold.

Afghan officials said Sunday that at least 27 insurgents have been killed
during the fighting.  NATO says one American and one British soldier were
killed on the first day of the offensive.  

During an interview Sunday on CNN, U.S. National Security Advisor James Jones
described the operation as going well.
