Police in central Pakistan's Punjab province say three suspected militants were
killed Saturday when a bomb they were carrying on a bicycle accidentally
exploded.
The explosion happened in Cheecha Watni, a town about 100 kilometers from the
city of Multan.
It is not immediately clear what sort of attack the men were planning.  Police
say at least two of the suspected militants were students at a local seminary,
and had links to Sipah-e-Sahaba, an outlawed Sunni Muslim group.
Police have been on high alert in Pakistan after a series of suicide bomb
attacks in recent weeks.
Last week, a suicide bombing killed at least 15 people in a courtroom in
Baluchistan province.
At least 36 suspects have been detained in connection with that attack.
Baluchistan borders Afghanistan and Iran.  It is widely believed to be used by
Taleban leaders for planning attacks against Afghan and U.S.-led forces in
Afghanistan.
