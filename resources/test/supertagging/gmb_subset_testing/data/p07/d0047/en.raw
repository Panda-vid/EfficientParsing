Dozens of people in Vietnam staged a short anti-Japan protest outside the
Japanese Embassy in Hanoi Sunday.
The demonstrators, wearing headbands and carrying banners in Chinese
characters, stood outside the embassy and shouted slogans. The protesters were
believed to be Chinese nationals living in Vietnam.
A heavy presence of Vietnamese police was on hand to prevent violence.
Demonstrations are rare in Vietnam where the communist government keeps a tight
lid on dissent.
Today's demonstration comes after days of violent protests in China over
Japan's wartime past and its bid for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security
Council.
