The European Union will start talks with Bosnia on Friday on an accord to move
the country closer to joining the 25-nation bloc.
The EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn will travel to Bosnia to open talks
on the Stabilization and Association Agreement. EU foreign ministers say
Bosnia's progress on the agreement depends on its willingness to continue
reforms and cooperate with the U.N. war crimes tribunal.
Two key Bosnian war crimes suspects, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and
army commander Ratko Mladic, remain at large.
The EU Monday also extended the mandate for the more than 6,000 peacekeeping
troops in Bosnia through next year.
The EU decisions came as senior Bosnian and U.N. diplomats meet in Washington
to mark the 10th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords, which ended the
three-year war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
