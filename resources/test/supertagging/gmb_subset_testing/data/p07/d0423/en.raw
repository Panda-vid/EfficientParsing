United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan says he believes another
investigation will be necessary into last month's assassination of former
Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri.
In a speech Wednesday to Arab leaders meeting in Algiers, Mr. Annan said that
within the next few days he expects to release a report on a fact-finding
mission into the February 14th killing. But he added that another more
comprehensive probe might be necessary.   
News reports from Lebanon say the U.N. fact-finding report is expected to
accuse Lebanese authorities of negligence and evidence tampering.
Lebanon's pro-Syrian government has said it was investigating the massive
bombing in Beirut that killed Mr. Hariri.  But there has been no official
statement on the probe. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Annan said he expected the withdrawal of Syrian troops from
Lebanon to be completed before Lebanese parliamentary elections set for May.
