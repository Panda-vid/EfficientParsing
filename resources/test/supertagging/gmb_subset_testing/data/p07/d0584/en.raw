Taliban militants have shot and killed a man for teaching English in eastern
Afghanistan, sparking a gunbattle that left two militants and two policemen
dead.
Provincial officials Thursday said the man was teaching English courses at a
school in the eastern Paktia province when he was killed Wednesday.
Police arrived on the scene and clashed with militants, resulting in casualties
on both sides.
Taliban militants have destroyed a number of schools in Afghanistan and
repeatedly target those seen as sympathetic to foreign governments.
Separately, U.S-led coalition troops Thursday said they killed several
militants in an operation on Wednesday in the southern Helmand province.
This year has been the deadliest in Afghanistan since a U.S.-led invasion
ousted the Taliban government in 2001. Taliban militants have established
strongholds in the south and east, attacking U.S. and NATO troops and Afghan
soldiers in ambushes and suicide bombings.
