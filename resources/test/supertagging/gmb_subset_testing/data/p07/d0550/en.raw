The landmark trial of a Congolese war crimes suspect has been temporarily
adjourned after the first witness suddenly recanted his earlier testimony.

The young man was testifying Wednesday against Thomas Lubanga, the first
suspect to go on trial at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.

The witness, whose name was not released, initially said Lubanga's men
recruited him off a street and sent him to a military training camp.  But after
a break, the witness told the court his earlier account was incorrect.  

Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda requested a delay to investigate what caused the man
to change his testimony, and to review measures designed to protect his safety.

Lubanga, a former Congolese militia leader, is accused of recruiting and using
children under the age of 15 as soldiers during hostilities in the eastern
Democratic Republic of Congo.
