%%% The landmark trial of a Congolese war crimes suspect has been temporarily adjourned after the first witness suddenly recanted his earlier testimony . The young man was testifying Wednesday against Thomas Lubanga , the first suspect to go on trial at the International Criminal Court in The Hague . The witness , whose name was not released , initially said Lubanga 's men recruited him off a street and sent him to a military training camp . But after a break , the witness told the court his earlier account was incorrect . Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda requested a delay to investigate what caused the man to change his testimony , and to review measures designed to protect his safety . Lubanga , a former Congolese militia leader , is accused of recruiting and using children under the age of 15 as soldiers during hostilities in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo .
