Prosecutors at the trial of Saddam Hussein have presented a document they said
is signed by Saddam approving the execution of 148 Shi'ite Muslim villagers.
The prosecutors Tuesday said the June 1984 document confirmed the death
sentences passed by a tribunal.
Saddam and seven others are on trial for the killings in Dujail, which happened
in a crackdown following an assassination attempt against Saddam.
Their trial resumed briefly Tuesday after a two week break with the defendants
and their legal team present. They had boycotted previous sessions.
Chief Judge Raouf Abdel-Rahman announced the five-judge panel rejected a
defense request to remove him and the chief prosecutor from the trial.
Saddam's head defense lawyer Khalil al-Dulaimi said he would appeal the
decision and asked for a halt in the court's proceedings. He then walked out of
the court.
The trial has been adjourned until Wednesday. The defendants face hanging if
convicted.
