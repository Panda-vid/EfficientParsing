The African Union says gunmen in Sudan's troubled Darfur region have killed
another A.U. peacekeeper.
An A.U. spokesman says the unidentified attackers shot the peacekeeper and
stole his vehicle late Saturday near the entrance of an A.U. compound in Al-
Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state. The nationality of the dead
peacekeeper was not disclosed.
Seven A.U. troops have been killed in Darfur so far this month.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte had visited the A.U. compound in
Al-Fasher Saturday. He is in Sudan to try to persuade the government to permit
the deployment of U.N. troops in Darfur.
TheÂ 7,000 A.U. peacekeepers currently in Darfur are poorly-equipped and have
failed to ease the violence obstructing humanitarian work in the region.
A Rwandan peacekeeper with the A.U. force was shot dead last Tuesday, while
gunmen killed five Senegalese peacekeepers on April 1.
