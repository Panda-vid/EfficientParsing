Pakistan has released 17 former Guantanamo Bay detainees who had been freed
from U.S. custody nine months ago and detained for further investigation on
their return to Pakistan.
The released men are part of a group of 35 Pakistani detainees who were cleared
by U.S. authorities last September.
A religious affairs adviser for the government in Punjab province says the men
were finally released today after they promised not to take part in militant
activities.
Hundreds of Pakistanis went to Afghanistan to fight alongside the Taleban
militia against the United States. After the Taleban regime was ousted in late
2001, many Pakistanis were jailed in Afghanistan, and some were sent to
Guantanamo.
