Officials in Pakistan say suspected tribal rebels blew up three natural gas
pipelines Saturday in southwestern Baluchistan province.
Gas company officials say the attacks disrupted natural gas supplies to several
districts, but caused no injuries.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombings.
Elsewhere, Pakistani security forces say they attacked a militant hideout near
the Afghan border, killing between 15 and 20 suspected militants.
A military statement said the operation began before dawn in the North
Waziristan tribal region, where foreign militants and their local supporters
are hiding.
Pakistan is trying to clear its rugged, semi-autonomous border lands of
militants, many of whom fled there after the overthrow of the Taleban in
Afghanistan.
