Russian officials say they will send a naval task force to the Caribbean later
this year for possible joint exercises with Venezuelan forces.
A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Andrei Nesterenk, says the nuclear-
powered battle cruiser Peter the Greatwill lead the naval mission, which will
also include the destroyer Admiral Chabanenko and other vessels including a
fuel tanker. The spokesman said anti-submarine aircraft will also be sent to
Venezuela, possibly in November.
The spokesman said the visit was planned long before the outbreak of the
Georgian conflict and is not directed against any third country.
Russian authorities have accused the United States of rearming Georgia while
using military vessels to deliver humanitarian aid to the Caucasus country.
U.S. officials have denied the charge
Venezuela's leftist President Hugo Chavez, a harsh critic of the U.S.
government, has forged closer ties with Moscow, including arms purchases and
other economic deals.
