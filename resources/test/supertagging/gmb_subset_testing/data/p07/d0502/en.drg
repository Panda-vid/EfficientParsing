%%% Russian officials say they will send a naval task force to the Caribbean later this year for possible joint exercises with Venezuelan forces . A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman , Andrei Nesterenk , says the nuclear-powered battle cruiser Peter the Great will lead the naval mission , which will also include the destroyer Admiral Chabanenko and other vessels including a fuel tanker . The spokesman said anti-submarine aircraft will also be sent to Venezuela , possibly in November . The spokesman said the visit was planned long before the outbreak of the Georgian conflict and is not directed against any third country . Russian authorities have accused the United States of rearming Georgia while using military vessels to deliver humanitarian aid to the Caucasus country . U.S. officials have denied the charge Venezuela 's leftist President Hugo Chavez , a harsh critic of the U.S. government , has forged closer ties with Moscow , including arms purchases and other economic deals .
