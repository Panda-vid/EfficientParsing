Pakistani officials say the suspected mastermind of the plot uncovered in
London last week to blow up U.S.-bound airplanes is hiding in a mountainous
region of northeastern Afghanistan.
The officials said Friday they told the U.S. military that the suspect, an al-
Qaida operative, is believed to be in Afghanistan's Kunar province, which
borders Pakistan. They have not disclosed his name.
They say the information was obtained by interrogators questioning British
suspect Rashid Rauf, who was arrested in eastern Pakistan and is regarded as a
key figure in the foiled plot.
Twenty-three people are in detention in Britain, and Pakistan is holding seven
suspects in the plot.
