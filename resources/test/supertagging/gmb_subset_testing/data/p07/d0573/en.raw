The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad says it has ordered its gunmen in
the Gaza Strip to stop firing rockets at Israeli targets while Israel prepares
for and completes its Gaza evacuation.
The group issued a statement Wednesday, a day after errant rocket fire into
southern Israel killed a Palestinian child and wounded eight other
Palestinians.Â  The Jihad statement denied responsibility.
Meanwhile, thousands of Jewish settlers and their right-wing supporters are
protesting for a second straight day in southern Israel against the mid-August
Gaza evacuation.
The protesters, encamped near the Israeli border town of Ofakim, have vowed to
march to nearby Gaza later Wednesday, despite Israeli warnings that 15,000
police deployed in the area will stop them.
Israel closed Gaza to all Israeli non-residents last month, and police and
troops have blocked earlier attempts by protesters to enter the territory.
