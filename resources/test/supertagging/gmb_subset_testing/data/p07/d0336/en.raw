Pakistan has sentenced five people to death for plotting to kill President
Pervez Musharraf two years ago.
Army spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan said Friday that the sentences were
given to one soldier and four civilians involved in the plot to ram an
explosives-laden vehicle into Mr. Musharraf's motorcade. The president was
unhurt in the attack in Rawalpindi, but 15 others died.
Earlier this month, authorities hanged a soldier linked to that attack and an
earlier plot against the president.
Mr. Musharraf has become a target for Islamic militants since joining the U.S.-
led war on terrorism after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.
