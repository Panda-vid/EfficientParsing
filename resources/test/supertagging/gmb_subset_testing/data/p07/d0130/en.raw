A suicide bomber in the Russia's Chechnya republic killed six people and
wounded at least 10 others outside a theater in the capital of Grozny on
Sunday.

Four of the victims were police officers who stopped the bomber from getting
inside the concert hall just before a show was to start.

Other victims included a Turk and a Georgian. The bomber, who was also killed,
has not yet been identified.

Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov says the attack will not stop efforts to wipe
out Chechen rebels.

Russian forces have been fighting Islamic separatists in southern Russia for
most of the last 15 years.
