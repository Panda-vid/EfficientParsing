An international donor's conference has opened in Beijing, where world health
officials hope to raise $1.5 billion to help stop the spread of bird flu.
Officials from about 90 countries are attending the two-day meeting sponsored
by The World Bank, European Union, and China.
United Nations bird flu official, Dr. David Nabarro, says the $1.5 billion is
to help poor countries set up prevention programs. He says much more would be
needed if bird flu becomes a global pandemic.
Health experts fear the deadly H5N1 strain could mutate into one that is easily
spread among humans and create a worldwide catastrophe.
Bird flu has killed more than 80 people in southeast Asia, China, and Turkey
since 2003.
