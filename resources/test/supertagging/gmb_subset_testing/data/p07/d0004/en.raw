American billionaire Bill Gates is donating another $258 million to the fight
against malaria, which kills more than one million people each year, mostly
African children.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced Sunday it is granting the money
to groups working on new drugs, a vaccine and better mosquito control to stop
malaria.
A new report by a the Malaria Research and Development Alliance says the $258
million donation equals more than three-quarters of the entire global spending
on research into the disease last year.
Mr. Gates told reporters Sunday it is "a tragedy that the world has done so
little" to stop the disease that kills 2,000 African children every day.
Mr. Gates, who founded computer software giant Microsoft, is the world's
wealthiest person.
