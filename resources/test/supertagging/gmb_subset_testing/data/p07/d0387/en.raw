U.S. President Barack Obama called the heads of the nation's largest banks to
the White House for talks Friday, in the latest effort to find ways to bolster
the battered U.S. economy.

Earlier this week, the Obama administration proposed a plan to help troubled
banks by using a government and private partnership to buy up to $1 trillion in
bad loans and other "toxic assets" from them.  

Thursday, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner urged Congress to approve the
administration's plan to expand the government's powers to monitor large
financial firms.  

There may be some faint signs the effort is working.  Economic data published
Friday shows consumer spending rose slightly and consumer sentiment improved a
small amount in February.  

Economists track consumer spending and their views of the economy because
consumer demand drives two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
