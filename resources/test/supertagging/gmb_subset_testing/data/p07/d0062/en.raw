Iraqi authorities say two car bombs in Baghdad have killed at least 23 people.
More than 80 people were wounded in the blasts, which went off in short
succession.  

The two blasts went off within moments of each other, one at a busy
intersection near a security ministry building in the north of the capital.  
The second car bomb exploded in western Baghdad, outside a mobile phone company
and close by a popular restaurant.

There were no immediate claims of responsibility.  

In a third incident Sunday, authorities said that at least one man was killed
when a home-made bomb attached to his car exploded.

The bombings are the deadliest since the U.S. officially changed the name of
its mission in Iraq earlier this month from one of combat to advice and
training, a move accompanied by a drawdown in U.S. forces.
