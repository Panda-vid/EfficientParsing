An international human rights group is urging NATO to stop transferring
detainees to Afghan security forces because of reports they torture their
prisoners.
Amnesty International says the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force
could be exposing prisoners to mistreatment and abuse by placing them in the
custody of the Afghan National Directorate of Security.
The rights group wants ISAF to temporarily suspend all prisoner handovers to
Afghan authorities until proper safeguards are in place.
The group says, in particular, ISAF troops from Belgium, Britain, Canada,
Norway and the Netherlands could be in violation of an agreement they signed
with the Afghan government on prison transfer and monitoring. Amnesty says the
agreement does not provide enough safeguards.
Amnesty International called on those countries not to rely on bilateral
agreements to protect prisoners from harsh treatment once they are transferred.
The rights group is calling for a complete reform of the Afghan detention
system.
