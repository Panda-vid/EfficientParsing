Afghan officials say President Hamid Karzai is considering offering a
government post to a powerful regional warlord, despite concerns over his role
in alleged human rights abuses.
A presidential spokesman Jawed Ludin told a news briefing in Kabul Tuesday that
General Abdul Rashid Dostum held several meetings with the president to discuss
a possible government position.
Asked about charges that General Dostum was guilty of human rights abuses and
war crimes, the spokesman said it was a completely different issue. He stressed
that everyone in Afghanistan has the right to fulfill their responsibilities
and be given opportunity to do so.
General Dostum's faction helped U.S. -led coalition forces oust the former
Taleban regime in 2001. He finished fourth in last year's presidential
elections and narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in January.
