The White House says President Bush will make an evening address to the nation
on Monday, the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the United
States.
It will be the latest in a series of speeches about terrorism that the
President has made in the past two weeks. He has been highlighting what he
calls the nation's progress in the war on terrorism, ahead of key midterm
elections in November.
A presidential spokesman said Friday that Mr. Bush's speech will be non-
political and will focus on what the September 11 attacks have meant to the
nation. On Sunday and Monday the president is scheduled to visit the sites of
the attacks in New York City, Shanksville, Pennsylvania and the Pentagon in
Washington.
Democrats accuse Mr. Bush of emphasizing anti-terror efforts lately to distract
from the increasingly unpopular war in Iraq.Â
