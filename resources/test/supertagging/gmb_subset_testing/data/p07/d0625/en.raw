The U.S. military has released more than 400 male Iraqi prisoners, after an
Iraqi-led review board found no reason to continue to keep them in custody.
The releases were announced Saturday. A U.S. statement said that since August
2004 the cases of about 28,000 detainees have been examined and about half of
them have been released.
Meanwhile, authorities say a U.S. soldier was killed Saturday by a roadside
bomb in Baghdad. Separately, at least three Iraq police were killed in another
roadside explosion in the city.
Also, police say the bodies of two blindfolded and bound men were found in
Baghdad - apparent victims of reprisal attacks by Shi'ite and Sunni extremists.
The Iraqi Interior Ministry is probing allegations that Shi'ite death squads
are operating within Iraqi police ranks.
