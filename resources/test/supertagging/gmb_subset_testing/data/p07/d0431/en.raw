U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has urged all Iraqis to refrain from acts of
violence and put aside their differences, in the wake of Monday's suicide car
bombing in Hilla that killed at least 125 people.
A statement issued through his spokesman condemned the attack as a flagrant
violation of international law that seeks to undermine the prospects of peace,
democracy and prosperity.
The attack, the deadliest of its kind since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime
in 2003, wounded more than 100 other people. Witnesses say the bomber drove a
car into a crowd of people seeking medical checkups needed for government jobs.
There has been no claim of responsibility. The White House condemned the
attack.
