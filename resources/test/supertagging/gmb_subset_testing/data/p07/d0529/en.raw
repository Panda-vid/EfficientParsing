The White House says President George Bush has reaffirmed strong U.S.-Pakistani
relations, in a phone call he made to Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf.
Friday's conversation between the two leaders took place a day after Mr.
Musharraf dismissed media speculation he is ready to resign.
He also said there are no differences between him and the chief of the
country's powerful military, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.
Mr. Musharraf was referring to a report in a Pakistani newspaper, The News
Daily, that speculated he was about to quit following a meeting with the
general on Wednesday.
The military said the two men discussed routine matters.
