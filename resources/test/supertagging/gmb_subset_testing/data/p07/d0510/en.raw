Top Palestinian officials have arrived in Lebanon for the first visit by
Palestinian leadership in more than two decades.
The head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Mahmoud Abbas, and Prime
Minister Ahmed Qureia are due to meet with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and
other top officials Wednesday.
Monday, Mr. Abbas was in Syria for landmark talks with Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad to discuss plans for future peace efforts with Israel.
The trips by Palestinian leaders to Lebanon and Syria are aimed at improving
relations that were strained under Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who died
last month.
Both countries opposed Mr. Arafat's signing of the Oslo peace accords in 1993,
saying the agreement derailed a joint Arab approach to peace with Israel.
