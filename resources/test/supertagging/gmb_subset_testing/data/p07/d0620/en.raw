Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan says the recent outbreak of bird
flu in Turkey is under control, as health officials confirmed the country's
15th human case of the H5N1 virus.
Mr. Erdogan said agricultural officials continue to closely monitor the
situation.
Agricultural workers say they have slaughtered some 300,000 birds and have
stepped up an information campaign to inform people about the dangers posed by
infected birds.
Some 70 people in Turkey are hospitalized with symptoms of avian influenza, but
the Associated Press quotes health officials as saying most of them have tested
negative for bird flu.
In Ukraine, health officials Tuesday confirmed new cases of H5N1 in birds at
three poultry farms on the Crimean peninsula.
Bird flu has killed more than 70 people in Asia since 2003, and at least two
people in Turkey.
