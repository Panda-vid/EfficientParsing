%%% Democratic Party officials say U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd of the northeastern state of Connecticut will seek the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination . The 62-year-old veteran lawmaker is expected to announce his candidacy Thursday on a nationally syndicated radio show . The son of a former U.S. senator , Dodd was elected to the House of Representatives in 1974 , and served three terms before his election to the Senate in 1980 . He voted to authorize military action against Iraq in 2002 , but has since become a vocal critic of President Bush 's handling of the war . Dodd joins a growing field of official candidates , including former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina , Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack , and Representative Dennis Kucinich of Ohio . Two other sitting senators , New York 's Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama of Illinois , are also considering seeking the nomination .
