U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says the Bush administration is still
considering setting up a diplomatic mission in Iran.

Rice refuted an Associated Press report that the administration had decided to
hand the issue to its successor.  She told reporters that Washington continues
to look at the idea.

On a flight from India to Kazakhstan for talks on other matters, Rice called
the idea interesting.  She did not comment further.

The United States and Iran are at odds over the Middle East country's nuclear
program.

Iran has ignored U.N. resolutions demanding that it stop uranium enrichment. 
U.S. and European governments fear that Iran is trying to build a nuclear bomb.


Tehran denies that and says it wants only to produce low-grade fuel for nuclear
energy.
 
The same enrichment process also could be used to produce highly enriched
uranium for nuclear weapons.
