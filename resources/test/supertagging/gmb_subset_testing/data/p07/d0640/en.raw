French President Jacques Chirac is preparing for a high-profile television
appearance to try to boost uncertain prospects for French ratification of the
European Union constitution.
Mr. Chirac will open his public campaign for the constitution this Thursday
evening in a televised debate with an audience of 80 young voters. His
appearance follows a string of opinion polls that have shown French voters
planning to reject the constitution in a referendum on May 29.
Pollsters say opponents plan to vote against the constitution to highlight
their fear of Turkish EU membership or to register their discontent with Mr.
Chirac's socio-economic policies.
Some critics say the constitution could cost French jobs and destroy the
country's social welfare system.
The constitution, aimed at streamlining EU decision-making, requires
ratification by all of the union's 25 member states to take effect.
