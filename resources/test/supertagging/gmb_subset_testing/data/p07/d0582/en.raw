The United States is formally protesting China's decision to deny a visa to
U.S. Olympic gold medalist and Darfur anti-violence campaigner Joey Cheek.
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Wednesday the U.S. is disturbed to
learn that China has refused his visa.
Cheek, a speedskater who competed in the 2006 Winter Olympics, had planned to
go to Beijing to support Olympic athletes who are members of Team Darfur. The
group aims to call attention to the humanitarian crisis in Sudan's Darfur
region.
China is a major investor in Sudan and has come under increasing pressure to
help end the violence in Darfur.
International experts say more than 200,000 people have died and some 2.5
million have been displaced from their homes since Darfur rebel groups rose up
against the Sudanese government in 2003.
Sudan says Western governments and media have exaggerated the scale of the
conflict.
