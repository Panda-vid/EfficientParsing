World oil prices soared to yet another record high in Thursday's trading,
increasing the threat of inflation and dimming prospects for global economic
growth.

The price of crude oil for future delivery went as high as $145.85 a barrel in
New York trading.

Analysts blamed the price hikes on a weak U.S. dollar, concerns about conflict
in the Middle East, and lower crude oil inventories.

Raising the price of oil boosts the cost of making many goods and increases the
cost of delivering everything, so soaring energy costs are increasing the
threat of inflation.

Thursday, the European Central Bank tried to fight inflation by raising
interest rates a quarter of a point to 4.25 percent.

Increasing interest rates slows the economy by raising the cost of borrowing
money to buy equipment to expand businesses or purchase homes.
