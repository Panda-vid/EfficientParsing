President Bush will visit the U.S. Gulf Coast Sunday as the region continues to
clean-up from Hurricane Katrina.
The visit will be Mr. Bush's third trip to the area since the devastating storm
hit nearly two weeks ago.
Cleanup and recovery efforts in New Orleans are showing signs of progress. The
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers now says it will take 40 days to pump the
floodwaters out of the city, cutting its original estimate in half.
The city's Louis Armstrong International Airport will reopen to passenger
traffic on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the block-to-block search continues for those killed when Katrina
hit landfall. Officials now cautiously say the death toll may be far lower than
the thousands originally feared.
The death toll now stands at nearly 400 across the region, with 154 in New
Orleans.
