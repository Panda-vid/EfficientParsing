%%% Israel 's Defense Minister - harshly criticized for his performance during last summer 's war in Lebanon - says he will leave the defense ministry , probably after his Labor party holds a leadership election late this month . Amir Peretz said in a Saturday interview on Israeli Television ( Channel 2 ) he intends to hand the defense ministry portfolio over to the Kadima party and ask for the finance ministry in exchange . Peretz and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert have been under pressure to resign since the release of a report that said the two men were responsible for serious failures in the war in Lebanon . Many Israelis consider the war a failure because Israel did not defeat Hezbollah or get back the two soldiers whose kidnapping by the Islamic militant group triggered the war .
