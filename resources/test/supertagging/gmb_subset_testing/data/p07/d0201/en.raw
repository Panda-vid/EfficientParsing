Israel's Defense Minister - harshly criticized for his performance during last
summer's war in Lebanon - says he will leave the defense ministry, probably
after his Labor party holds a leadership election late this month.
Amir Peretz said in a Saturday interview on Israeli Television (Channel 2) he
intends to hand the defense ministry portfolio over to the Kadima party and ask
for the finance ministry in exchange.
Peretz and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert have been under pressure to
resign since the release of a report that said the two men were responsible for
serious failures in the war in Lebanon.
Many Israelis consider the war a failure because Israel did not defeat
Hezbollah or get back the two soldiers whose kidnapping by the Islamic militant
group triggered the war.
