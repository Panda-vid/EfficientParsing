Police in Denmark have arrested four Danish Muslims suspected of plotting a
terror attack in Europe.
The four, aged between 16 and 20, were arrested in and around Copenhagen on
Thursday and ordered held while police conduct an investigation.
The arrests were made on a tip the Danish intelligence service PET had received
from another country.
Authorities say the arrests are linked to an investigation in Bosnia, in which
a Turk, a Swede and a Bosnian were arrested in Sarajevo on October 19 and 20 on
suspicion of preparing a terrorist attack.
Following the July 7 bus and subway bombings in London, Denmark, an American
ally in Iraq, has also been identified as a terrorist target.
