Iraqi police say a roadside bomb blast south of Baghdad has killed seven police
officers.
The policemen were in a convoy traveling on a road east of the city of
Diwaniyah.
The region south of Baghdad is known for frequent clashes between rival Shi'ite
groups and violence against U.S.-led forces.
North of Baghdad, authorities say a suicide truck bomber hit a checkpoint
operated by Kurdish peshmerga militiamen at Jalawla in Diyala province, killing
one and wounding 10.
Separately, the U.S. military says coalition forces detained 15 suspects in
operations targeting al-Qaida in Iraq terrorists in central and northern parts
of the country early Wednesday.
