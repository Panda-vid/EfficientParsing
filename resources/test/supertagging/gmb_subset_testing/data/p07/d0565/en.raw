Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Saturday the United States
and Israel are his country's main enemies.
In a televised speech, Khamenei said hatred toward the U.S. is growing around
the world.  His remarks come just three days after the United States rejected
an Iranian suggestion to hold higher-level talks on the security situation in
Iraq.
Iran suggested the talks as U.S. and Iranian ambassadors to Iraq met in Baghdad
to discuss Iraq's security.
The U.S. has accused Iran of supplying weapons and training to Shi'ite militias
in Iraq.  Iran denies the charge.
Khamenei's comments came as he marked the birthday of Imam Ali, the first Imam
of Shia Muslims.
The United States and Iran have had little official contact for 27 years. 
Washington broke off diplomatic relations in April 1980 several months after
Iranian activists seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took its staff hostage.
