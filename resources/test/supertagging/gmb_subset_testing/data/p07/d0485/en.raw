Sri Lanka's military says rebels have ambushed a navy bus in the east of the
country, wounding 12 sailors and sparking a gunbattle in which two civilians
also died.
Officials blame Tamil rebels for Tuesday's attack in Trincomalee. They say the
rebels set off a fragmentation mine as the navy bus passed by, and then opened
fire on the bus with small arms. Officials say the sailors shot back, and two
civilians were killed in the crossfire.
Sri Lanka's government says at least 69 security personnel have been killed by
rebels since early December. The violence has severely strained a ceasefire
signed by both sides in 2002.
