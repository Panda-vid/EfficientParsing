Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas and the exiled political leader of the
militant group Hamas have held a rare meeting in Cairo, their first since their
parties formed a coalition government.
Mr. Abbas of the moderate Fatah movement and Hamas' political chief Khaled
Mashaal met Friday in Cairo.
They had been expected to discuss an exchange of prisoners with Israel, the
internal situation in the Palestinian territory, and an effort to lift
international sanctions against the Palestinian government.
Details of the meeting have not been released.
The rival Palestinian groups Fatah and Hamas formed a unity government in
March. The two sides hoped to end a Western embargo against the Palestinian
authority and to end months of factional fighting that killed more than 130
people.
