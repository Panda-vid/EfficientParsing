BBC journalist Alan Johnston, released Wednesday by Palestinian kidnappers in
the Gaza Strip, has received an award for human rights reporting from Amnesty
International.
Amnesty International's director for Britain, Kate Allen, said the judges of
the annual media awards were determined not to let Johnston's kidnapping affect
their judgment. She said they were impressed by his insight and commitment to
telling stories of everyday life in Gaza.
The award was one of nine that Amnesty gave out during a ceremony in London
Wednesday just hours after Johnston's release. His father accepted the award
for him, saying, "It's been quite a day."
Johnston was the only Western reporter based in Gaza when he was abducted in
March. After his release, he compared his four months in captivity to being
buried alive."
