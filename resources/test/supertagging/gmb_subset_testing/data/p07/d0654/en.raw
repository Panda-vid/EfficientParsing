Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has arrived in the country's
southern port city of Karachi to try to quell unrest that has killed at least
85 people.

Monday's assassination of provincial lawmaker Raza Haider triggered four days
of riots, with protesters opening fire and burning vehicles and shops.

Haider was a member of the Muttahida Quami Movement or MQM, which is part of
the ruling political coalition in both Sindh province and the federal
government.

The party, which largely represents the Urdu-speaking community, and the Awami
National Party or ANP, which represents ethnic Pashtuns, have blamed each other
for the violence.

Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik has said Taliban-linked militants
looking to fuel political tensions were behind Haider's assassination.

Malik met with representatives from both the MQM and ANP on Friday.Â  Political
leaders were due to meet with Prime Minister Gilani later in the day.
