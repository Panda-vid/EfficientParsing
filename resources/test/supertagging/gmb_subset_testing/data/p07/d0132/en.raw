The state-run Russian company building Iran's nuclear power station says the
launch date has been postponed because of Iran's payment delays.
Officials at Atomstroyexport say it is impossible to launch the reactor in
September. They added there will be no delivery of nuclear fuel this month as
earlier agreed.
Russia has accused Iran of missing payments on the nuclear plant. Iran has
denied the claim.
Iranian and Russian officials met in Moscow last week, but failed to solve
their financial dispute.
Russia's Interfax news agency quotes a Russian foreign ministry spokesman,
Andre Krivtsov, as saying Moscow hopes the two countries will find a mutual
solution to their funding problem.
The United Nations Security Council has expressed concern that Iran could use
uranium enrichment technology to develop nuclear weapons.
Iran says its nuclear program is only for energy purposes.
