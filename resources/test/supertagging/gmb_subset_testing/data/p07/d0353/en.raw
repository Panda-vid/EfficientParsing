A flurry of reports Tuesday shows problems for the U.S. economy in the
services, retail, factory, and housing sectors.

Services make up the vast majority of the world's largest economy, but were hit
hard in December as consumers cut spending and housing slumped.

However, the industry group the Institute for Supply Management that tracks the
data says December's figures showed the services sector shrinking at a slower
rate than the prior month.

Retail sales are also troubled.  Big discounts following the Christmas holiday,
December 25, had consumers shopping for bargains, but were not enough to help
retailers salvage a disappointing holiday shopping season.  An industry group,
the International Council of Shopping Centers, says sales fell almost one
percent last week, compared to the same time last year.

Other reports Tuesday show U.S. factory orders falling sharply and pending home
resales off sharply in November.
