Top-seeded Anabel Medina Garrigues of Spain is the winner of the Canberra
International tennis tournament in Australia. She overcame South Korea's Cho
Yoon-jeong in three sets on Friday, 6-4, 0-6, 6-4.
Medina Garrigues raced to a 5-1 lead in the first set before Cho won the next
three games. The 23-year-old Spaniard served out the set to take it 6-4.
Cho won the next eight games and led 2-0 in the deciding third set before
Medina Garrigues rallied and claimed six of the next eight games to win her
fifth WTA title.
This was Cho's third appearance in a WTA tour final, but her first since 2003
when she had jaw surgery. She has a difficult opponent in her opening round
match at next week's Australian Open in Melbourne, as she has to face world
number two Kim Clijsters of Belgium.
