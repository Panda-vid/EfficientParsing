A member of an Islamic terrorist group in the U.S. has been sentenced to 12.5
years in prison for plotting attacks against targets in Los Angeles,
California.

Gregory Patterson pleaded guilty to conspiracy to wage war against the United
States and possession of a firearm.  The 24-year-old was sentenced Monday by a
U.S. District Court.

Patterson was among four men charged in connection with the plot.  Targets
included the Los Angeles International Airport, U.S. military recruiting
centers, and the Israeli Consulate.

Last month, co-conspirator Levar Washington was sentenced to 22 years
imprisonment for conspiracy and weapons charges.

The men belonged to Jam'iyyat Ul-Islam Is-Saheeh, a local terrorist cell
founded by Kevin James in 1997 while he was in prison.  James is expected to be
sentenced early next year.

A fourth co-conspirator, Hammad Samana, was declared unfit to stand trial and
is in a psychiatric facility.
