Venezuela has rejected accusations from U.S. Secretary of State-nominee
Condoleezza Rice that it meddles in the affairs of other Latin American
countries.
At a news conference in Caracas Wednesday, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Ali
Rodriguez called the comments from Ms. Rice "unacceptable." He denied that the
government of President Hugo Chavez interferes in other countries' affairs, and
accused the United States of trying to meddle in Venezuela's affairs.
Ms. Rice made her comments Tuesday at her U.S. Senate confirmation hearing. She
called the Chavez government a "negative force" that affects other countries
and suppresses opposing voices. She also said the relationship between the
leftist Mr. Chavez and Cuban leader Fidel Castro has been "deeply troubling."
U.S.-Venezuelan relations have been tense since Mr. Chavez took power in 1999.
