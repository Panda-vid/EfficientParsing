The United Nations says it will summon more Syrian officials for questioning in
its probe of the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-
Hariri.
In an interview with Lebanon's al-Mustaqbal newspaper, which is owned by the
Hariri family, U.N. chief investigator Detlev Mehlis says he will ask
permission from Syria in the next few days to question more officials about the
assassination. He did not specify which officials he wants to question.
International investigators interrogated five Syrian officials in the Austrian
capital, Vienna, this week in connection with the February 14 truck bomb that
killed Mr. Hariri and 22 others.
Mr. Mehlis said the Vienna interviews were more fruitful than a series of
earlier interrogation sessions in Damascus.
In an interim report in October, the U.N. investigator implicated senior Syrian
security officials and their Lebanese allies in the murder.
