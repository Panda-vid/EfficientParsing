Muzaffarabad, a city of 600,000 people that was shaken to pieces by the Kashmir
earthquake, is a scene of chaos Monday, with survivors ransacking shops in a
desperate hunt for food and fuel.
Reports from Pakistani Kashmir say angry crowds attacked military trucks that
entered the city today, carrying the first shipments of tents, blankets and
medicine for Muzaffarabad.
Military officials say Saturday's earthquake killed at least 11,000 people in
Muzaffarabad and left more than 120,000 others in urgent need of shelter. Aid
agencies say conditions are even worse in many smaller towns and villages.
A VOA correspondent who traveled with a military convoy from Pakistan's North-
West Frontier Province into the disaster zone today says helicopters are
airlifting the most seriously injured survivors out of Muzaffarabad. Crowds
have gathered at a stadium in the center of the city. Bodies of scores of dead
are piled on the stadium steps.
