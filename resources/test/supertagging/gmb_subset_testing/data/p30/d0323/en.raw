Leaders from the Palestinian militant group Hamas say Palestinian Authority
President Mahmoud Abbas will formally ask their prime minister-designate to
form a government on Tuesday.
Following talks with Mr. Abbas, Hamas leaders said the president would present
Ismail Haniyeh with a formal letter of appointment and officially begin the
process of filling Cabinet posts.
Hamas dominated recent parliamentary elections, and the naming of Ismail
Haniyeh as prime minister is a formality.
Mr. Abbas said Sunday that the new government faces a financial crisis after
Israel stopped the monthly transfer of millions of dollars in customs revenue
it collects for the Palestinian Authority.
Western nations have also threatened to cut funds unless Hamas renounces
violence and accepts Israel's right to exist.
Also Monday, other Hamas leaders met with Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei in Tehran. The ayatollah urged Muslim nations to provide financial
support to the Palestinian government.
