Somali President Abdullahi Yusuf Amhed says he will hold a national
reconciliation conference in the coming weeks to help the country return to
peace.
Speaking during a Thursday visit to London, Mr. Yusuf said the conference will
be open to moderate Islamists. He said the only conditions for taking part in
the talks are to lay down weapons, renounce violence and be committed to a
peaceful Somalia.
Ethiopian and Somali government troops drove Islamist forces from the capital,
Mogadishu, late last year. Since then, insurgents have mounted frequent
attacks, which have killed many people, mainly civilians.
At least two mortar rounds landed near Mogadishu's international airport
Thursday, but no injuries were reported. And officials say unknown gunmen shot
to death two local government officials in the capital late Wednesday.
