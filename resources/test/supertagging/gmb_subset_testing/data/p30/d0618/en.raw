The death toll in the crash of a passenger plane in northern China now stands
at 54, with the discovery of one victim on the ground.
The official Xinhua news agency had earlier reported two people had been killed
on the ground, but later changed the figure to one.
The China Eastern Airlines jet, carrying 53 passengers and crew, plunged into a
lake in Nanhai Park just seconds after taking off from Baotou city in Inner
Mongolia at about 8:20 a.m., local time [0020 UTC].
Witnesses said they heard a blast while the plane was still in the air. The
aircraft broke into flaming fragments as it came down, damaging a house near
the lake and scorching several yachts.
The aircraft was a Canadian-made Bombardier CRJ-200, a commuter jet designed to
carry 50 passengers.
