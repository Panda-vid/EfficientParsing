Israeli and Palestinian security officials met Sunday for the first time since
Israel froze contacts after a suicide bombing nearly two weeks ago.
Generals from both sides met to map out plans for the withdrawal of Israeli
forces from five West Bank cities and towns that Israel re-occupied during the
recently-halted Palestinian uprising.
The withdrawal is part of a package of pledges made by Israel during an
Israeli-Palestinian summit early last month.
As the generals met, Israeli security sources revealed that Defense Minister
Shaul Mofaz will meet with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in the coming days
to further the often-stalled Mideast peace process.
Israel suspended its diplomacy after a Palestinian suicide bombing killed five
Israelis February 25 in a Tel Aviv nightclub.
