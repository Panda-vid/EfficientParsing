Officials for the 2012 London Olympics have announced the costs and confirmed
the builders for the Olympic Stadium and aquatic center.
The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) said Tuesday the 80,000 - seat Olympic
Stadium will cost about $976 million and will be built by a consortium
including HOK Sport, Buro Happold and Robert Alpine.
The price includes the cost of converting the stadium to a 25,000 seat
multiple-use venue after the Olympics.
Meanwhile, the Aquatics Center and land bridge that will be a main gateway into
the Olympic Park will cost some $476 million. The venue, which will be built by
Balfour Beatty, will seat 2,500 people when it is reconfigured after the Games.
