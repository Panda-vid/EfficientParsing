Pope John Paul is hailing the European Union's newly-signed constitution, while
urging Europe to remember its Christian roots.
In his weekly appearance at St. Peter's Square in Rome, the pope described
Friday's signing of the EU constitution as a significant moment in the creation
of a new Europe.
But the pope added that Europe's Christian heritage remains a fundamental part
of the Union's future.
The Vatican had pushed unsuccessfully for a reference to Europe's Christian
tradition in the constitution.
On Saturday, Italy's candidate for the European Union's top executive body,
Rocco Buttiglione - a conservative Catholic - stepped down from consideration
following controversial remarks that included his description of homosexuality
as a sin.
