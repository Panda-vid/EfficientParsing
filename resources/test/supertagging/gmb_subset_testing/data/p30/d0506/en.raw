The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, has
asked judges to report Sudan to the U.N. Security Council for failing to comply
with court warrants.
Earlier this week, Moreno-Ocampo formally requested the judges issue a finding
of "non-cooperation" against Sudan's government for failing to hand over former
Humanitarian Affairs Minister Ahmed Harun and militia leader Ali Kushayb.
The two men were charged in 2007 with committing crimes against humanity and
war crimes in Sudan's war-torn Darfur region.
Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir is also wanted by the court for alleged war
crimes in Darfur.
He has refused to comply with a warrant for his arrest.
Darfur rebel groups have been fighting the Sudanese government since 2003.
The United Nations says the fighting and related violence has killed up to
300,000 people and displaced some 2.7 million others. Sudan puts the death toll
at 10,000.
