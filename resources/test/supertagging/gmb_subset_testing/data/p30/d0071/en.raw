into the death of his predecessor, John Garang, with the Ugandan president.

that Mr. Salva Kiir expressed satisfaction with the progress of the
investigation.

forces with the Ugandan army to fight the rebel Lord's Resistance Army in
northern Uganda.

was traveling in crashed. Mr. Garang had been in Uganda to visit with President
Museveni, a long-time ally.

officials from Uganda, Sudan, Kenya the United States and the United Nations.
