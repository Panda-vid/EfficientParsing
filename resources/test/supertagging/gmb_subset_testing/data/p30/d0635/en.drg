%%% Colombian President Alvaro Uribe says the country 's domestic intelligence agency will no longer be in charge of intercepting communications , after it came under investigation for an illegal wiretapping scandal . Mr. Uribe announced Thursday that all wiretaps will now be conducted by the national police , and will require judicial authorization . The domestic intelligence agency , known as DAS ( the Department of Administrative Security ) is under federal investigation over charges that its agents illegally wiretapped politicians , journalists and judges . The agency is accused of passing intercepted information to drug traffickers and other illegal armed groups . The accusations were first made by the Colombian news magazine " Semana . " DAS has been accused of wrongful spying in the past . Last year , the head of the agency , Maria del Pilar Hurtado , resigned after it was revealed that agents were ordered to spy on opposition leaders .
