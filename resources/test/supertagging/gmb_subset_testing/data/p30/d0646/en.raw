Human Rights Watch says the international community is not doing enough to stop
the violence in Sudan's western Darfur region.
Executive Director Kenneth Roth, in a statement, said the world has responded
to the crisis by expressing concern and feigning action, but nothing more.
He said it is not enough to condemn atrocities in Darfur and to send a handful
of African Union troops to, "merely observe the slaughter" of civilians.
A.U. troops in Darfur are not mandated to protect civilians.
Mr. Roth also said the international community has put no serious pressure on
the Sudanese government to stop what he called its "murderous campaign."
The United Nations and western countries, including the United States, have
accused Sudan of backing Arab militia who have waged a campaign of murder and
rape.Â  Sudan denies the charge.
