Arabic language al-Jazeera television has broadcast what it says is a new
videotape of kidnapped U.S. journalist Jill Carroll pleading for freedom for
female Iraqi prisoners.
The tape is time-stamped January 28, showing Carroll dressed in traditional
Islamic headscarf and crying.
Al Jazeera did not broadcast any sound with the tape Monday. But a newscaster
said Carroll appealed to the U.S. military in Iraq to free all women prisoners.
This was the main demand of her captors who threatened to kill her if it was
not met.
Carroll is a journalist for the U.S. based Christian Science Monitor newspaper.
She was kidnapped January 7.
The U.S. military freed five female prisoners in Iraq last week, but said their
release was not connected to the Carroll case.
