The United Nations says Somali gunmen who hijacked a U.N.-chartered vessel
carrying food aid for tsunami victims have released the ship after holding it
for more than two months.
A spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Program, Rene McGuffin, says the vessel
is en route to the Somali port of El-Maan and is expected to arrive in a few
days.
She says the U.N. agency has negotiated with El-Maan port authorities to ensure
a free passage of the food aid to Somalia's transitional government for
distribution.
The World Food Program hired the Kenyan vessel to carry 850 metric tons of rice
donated by Japan and Germany. The ship and its 10-person crew was hijacked by
pirates as it sailed from Kenya to Somalia in June.
