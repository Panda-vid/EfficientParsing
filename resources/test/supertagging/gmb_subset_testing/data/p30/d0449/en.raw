Two surveys of Americans this week suggest support for President Bush is near
or at an all-time low.
A poll by CNN, USA Today and the Gallup released Friday indicates 38 percent of
Americans approve of the way the president is handling his job, a point higher
than the record low the group found last November. 
Those surveyed noted concerns over the war in Iraq, the influence business has
on the administration, and the state of health care.  The recent controversy
over a Dubai company taking over management at some U.S. ports did not appear
to have influenced respondents' opinions.
A poll earlier in the week by CBS News found Mr. Bush's popularity at an all-
time low, 34 percent, with those questioned voicing discontent with the port
deal, the government response to Hurricane Katrina, and the Iraq war.
