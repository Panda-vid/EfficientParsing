With vote counting nearly completed, Liberia appears headed for a presidential
run-off election between football (soccer) star George Weah and former World
Bank economist Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf.
Neither candidate captured the outright majority in last Tuesday's vote to
avoid the run-off, which is expected to be held November 8.
The latest tally shows Mr. Weah leading the field of 22 candidates with 28.9
percent of the vote. Ms. Johnson-Sirleaf is second with 19.7 percent. More than
90 percent of polling stations had reported results as of early Monday.
Last week's presidential and parliamentary elections were the first in Liberia
since a peace deal in 2003 ended 14 years of warfare and sent former President
Charles Taylor into exile.
