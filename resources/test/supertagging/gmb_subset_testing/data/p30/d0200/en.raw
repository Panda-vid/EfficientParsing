A Latina member of the U.S. Congress has accused Republicans of scapegoating
illegal immigrants.
In the Democratic party's weekly radio address Saturday, Hilda Solis of
California said Republicans have steadily built up an assault on immigrants
over the past few years to divide voters and win elections.
The lawmaker, the child of Mexican and Nicaraguan immigrants, said a House bill
that criminalizes being or helping illegal immigrants is alienating all
Americans.
Solis called for renewed debate on immigration reform as soon as Congress
returns from its two-week recess. She said reform should be tough, smart, and
comprehensive, yet compassionate.
