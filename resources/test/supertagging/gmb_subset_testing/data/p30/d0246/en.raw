A sports agent based in the U.S. state of California has been found guilty of
smuggling Cuban baseball players into the United States.
A court in Key West, Florida, found Gustavo Dominguez guilty Thursday on 21
federal charges, including conspiracy, smuggling, transporting, and harboring
illegal immigrants. Most of the charges carry a maximum prison sentence of 10
years. Dominguez is free until his sentencing July 9. His lawyer says they will
appeal.
Dominguez was on trial for smuggling five baseball players from Cuba to Florida
in 2004. Only two are still playing baseball. Osbek Castillo is a pitcher for
the Arizona Diamondbacks' feeder team in Alabama, while Francisely Bueno
pitches for the Atlanta Braves' feeder team in Mississippi.
