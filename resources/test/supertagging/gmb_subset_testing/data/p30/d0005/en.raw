An international human rights group is urging Iran to stop executing people
under the age of 18.
Human Rights Watch says Iran executes more minors than any other country in the
world. It says Iran has carried out 17 such executions since 2004. It says some
juveniles were given death sentences for crimes they committed when they were
15.
An official with the rights group says Iran needs to stop sending children to
the gallows and live up to its international obligations by banning the
juvenile death penalty.
Human Rights Watch says the only other countries known to have executed
juveniles since 2004 are Sudan, which executed two juveniles and China and
Pakistan, which each executed one.
