Iran has warned that it will make what it calls "unilateral decisions"
regarding its nuclear program if Europe refers the Islamic Republic to the
United Nations Security Council for sanctions.
The warning Sunday by an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi
comes just days before the resumption of high-level talks with France, Germany
and Britain.
He told journalists that negotiations this week in Geneva will prove whether
Tehran can reach an agreement with Europe.
Iran has raised the stakes in the negotiations by threatening to resume
processing uranium, a step in its nuclear program that could allow it to
manufacture nuclear reactor fuel or weapons-grade nuclear material.
Tehran says its nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes. The United
States says it is meant to hide a secret weapons program.
