The New York Times newspaper reports the Pentagon used military analysts
working for U.S. television networks to generate favorable coverage of the war
in Iraq and other issues.
The newspaper Sunday said the analysts were invited to private briefings with
senior military leaders, taken on tours of Iraq and given access to classified
intelligence.
The Times also said viewers were not made aware that most of the analysts have
ties to military contractors. Many of the analysts are retired high-ranking
military officials.
The report says the companies included large defense businesses and smaller
companies that had a vested interest in the war policies the analysts
discussed.
The Times quotes a Pentagon spokesman, Bryan Whitman, as saying the analysts
had been given only factual information about the war.
The newspaper says it based its report onÂ 8,000 email messages, transcripts and
records it secured after winning a lawsuit against the Pentagon.
