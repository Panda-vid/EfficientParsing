Automobile sales in the United States fell in June as high gasoline prices kept
consumers away from trucks and sports utility vehicles that require a lot of
fuel.

U.S.-based General Motors, the world's largest carmaker, Tuesday announced
sales fell more than 18 percent in June from the same month last year.   GM's
Japanese rival Toyota reports its sales fell more than 21 percent.

In a statement, GM said its truck market has been affected by the sudden rise
in fuel prices.  But, it says demand is continuing to grow for hybrid cars,
which use less fuel than conventional vehicles because they combine a gasoline
engine with high-tech batteries and electric motors.

On Friday, a major U.S. credit-rating service announced renewed concerns about
the top three American automakers, GM, Ford and Chrysler, due to the industry-
wide sales slump.
