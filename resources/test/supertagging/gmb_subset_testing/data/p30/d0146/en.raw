The Norwegian Nobel Institute has announced a near-record number of nominations
for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.
The five-member awards committee says there are 191 nominations.  Last year's
award to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its leader Mohamed
ElBaradei followed a record 199 nominees.
The committee keeps the nomination list secret.  The institute's director Geir
Lundestad would only say 168 individuals and 23 organizations were suggested
from all parts of the world.
However, those who submit nominations can announce their selections.
Nominees include a former Finnish President and Indonesian President for
negotiating peace in Indonesia's Aceh province.   
Also on the list are U2 singer Bono and Live 8 organizer Bob Geldof for their
work on poverty eradication.
The Peace Prize is awarded on December 10 in Oslo.
