Afghan and coalition forces have killed at least 48 suspected militants in two
operations in southern Afghanistan.

An Afghan army general, Sher Mohammad Zazai, said Wednesday that 23 suspected
Taliban fighters had been killed after Afghan and coalition forces stormed a
Taliban stronghold near the capital of Uruzgan province.  The general said
regional Taliban commander Mullah Ismail was among the militants killed in the
assault.

In neighboring Helmand province, Afghan officials said troops killed at least
25 suspected militants.  The Taliban-dominated province is where more than 500
British soldiers began carrying out a major air assault on a Taliban stronghold
late last week.   

Meanwhile, Afghan officials said at least seven civilians were killed in a
roadside bombing in Helmand province.

In southern Zabul province, local officials said two Afghan intelligence
officers and four alleged Taliban fighters were killed Tuesday in separate
incidents.
