A senior Pakistani security official says security forces have arrested a
suspected Al-Qaida militant believed to have been involved with the London
terrorist attacks of July 2005.

The official, who asked not to be named, told Western news agencies that Zabi
ul-Taifi was arrested along with six fellow militants in a pre-dawn raid
outside the northwestern city of Peshawar.

He said Taifi is an Arab national wanted in connection to the July 7, 2005,
terrorist attacks on London's mass transit system.

The four coordinated bombings killed 52 commuters. British police say three of
the four bombers were British citizens of Pakistani origin who are believed to
have trained in Al-Qaida camps in Pakistan or Afghanistan.
