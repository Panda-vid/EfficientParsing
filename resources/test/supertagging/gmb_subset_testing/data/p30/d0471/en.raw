Burma's pro-democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is resting at her home in
Rangoon after being treated at a hospital for a stomach illness.
A spokesman for her party, the National League for Democracy, tells reporters
she was taken to the hospital Friday, but is now back at home. He said she was
suffering from acute diarrhea.
The Burmese military confirmed that the pro-democracy leader has been sick. It
has confined her to her home for much of the past two decades.
On Friday, the military leadership confirmed that Aung San Suu Kyi's house
arrest was extended in May for another year. The government said she remains a
threat to the state.
The United States, Britain and several of Burma's neighbors in Southeast Asia
have urged the military to release Aung San Suu Kyi and take steps toward
political reconciliation in Burma.
