Uruguay's President-elect Tabare Vazquez has announced his administration will
re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba.
Mr. Vazquez announced his plans Wednesday in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo,
at a meeting of the leaders of his Broad Front coalition. The socialist leader
said Uruguay will resume diplomatic ties with Havana on March first, when he
takes office.
Outgoing Uruguayan President Jorge Battle severed diplomatic ties with Cuba in
April, 2002.
Mr. Vazquez, an oncologist and former mayor of Montevideo, was elected
president two weeks ago on the Broad Front ticket, with just slightly more than
50 percent of the vote. His election ended 170 years of conservative party
dominance.
