%%% Uruguay 's President-elect Tabare Vazquez has announced his administration will re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba . Mr. Vazquez announced his plans Wednesday in the Uruguayan capital , Montevideo , at a meeting of the leaders of his Broad Front coalition . The socialist leader said Uruguay will resume diplomatic ties with Havana on March first , when he takes office . Outgoing Uruguayan President Jorge Battle severed diplomatic ties with Cuba in April , 2002 . Mr. Vazquez , an oncologist and former mayor of Montevideo , was elected president two weeks ago on the Broad Front ticket , with just slightly more than 50 percent of the vote . His election ended 170 years of conservative party dominance .
