A purported spokesman for the Taleban says members of the group have killed
four kidnapped foreigners but released their four Afghan colleagues.
He said the foreigners were killed without demands because demands were never
met in the past. But there is no independent confirmation about the fate of the
eight men.
The four ethnic Albanians and four Afghans were abducted in an area between the
restive southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand. They all worked for Ecolog,
a German cleaning company contracted to U.S.-led forces.
In a separate development, U.S. military officials say coalition forces have
detained 11 militants suspected of involvement in a bombing that killed four
American troops in eastern Kunar province Sunday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. military says another American serviceman was killed Monday
when his vehicle overturned during a combat operation in eastern Nangarhar
province.
