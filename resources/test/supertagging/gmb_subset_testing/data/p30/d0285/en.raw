European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana is visiting Afghanistan
Tuesday for talks with the country's political leaders on the upcoming
presidential election.

Solana met with Afghan Foreign Minister Rangin Dadfar Spanta to discuss the
latest developments in the region.

He is also scheduled to meet with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, several of the
country's election candidates, as well as, the head of the EU election
observation mission in Afghanistan.

The  European Union is deploying about 100 observers to help monitor
Afghanistan's presidential and provincial elections on August 20.  Seventeen EU
experts are already in the country to monitor pre-election preparations.

Solana's visit follows talks in neighboring Pakistan where he pledged EU
support for the nearly two million people displaced by an anti-Taliban
operation in the country's northwest.
