After September 11, Russia, India, and China joined the United States' anti-
terrorism coalition. Some political analysts suggest that a major motive was to
gain international acceptance for these countries' own policies toward
minorities such as the Chechens, Kashmiris, Tibetans, and Uighurs. Of these
groups, the least well known are the Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim people
of northwestern China.
Since the People's Republic of China was founded, the Uighurs have resisted
Beijing's attempts to control their religious and political activities. In the
past few years, Uighur separatist groups have been blamed for attacks in
northwest China as well as the capital. Chinese officials have warned that
Beijing will not tolerate separatism or social disturbances under the guise of
religion.
Judith Latham explores the condition of the "Uighurs of China" in this edition
of Dateline.
