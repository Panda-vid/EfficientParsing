China and Cuba have signed 16 agreements as Chinese President Hu Jintao
continues his visit to Havana. Mr. Hu and his Cuban counterpart, Fidel Castro,
witnessed the signings late Monday in the Cuban capital, Havana.
The accords include deals to build a nickel production plant in Cuba and
setting up a joint venture to explore untapped Cuban nickel deposits. In
addition, China agreed to a 10-year extension for repayment of loans given to
Cuba in the 1990s.
Cuban state-run media say Mr. Hu's visit is a sign of the high priority both
countries give to the development of their bilateral relations.
Cuba has suffered economically since the collapse of its former backer, the
Soviet Union, more than a decade ago.
