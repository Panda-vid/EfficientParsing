%%% High population density , limited land and sea access , continuing isolation , and strict internal and external security controls have degraded economic conditions in the Gaza Strip - the smaller of the two areas in the Palestinian Territories . Israeli-imposed crossings closures , which became more restrictive after HAMAS violently took over the territory in June 2007 , and fighting between HAMAS and Israel during December 2008 - January 2009 , resulted in the near collapse of most of the private sector , extremely high unemployment , and high poverty rates . Shortages of goods are met through large-scale humanitarian assistance - led by UNRWA - and the HAMAS-regulated black market tunnel trade that flourishes under the Gaza Strip 's border with Egypt . However , changes to the blockade in 2010 included moving from a white list - in which only approved items were allowed into Gaza through the crossings - to a black list , where all but non-approved items were allowed into Gaza through the crossings . Israeli authorities have recently signaled that exports from the territory might be possible in the future , but currently regular exports from Gaza are not permitted .
