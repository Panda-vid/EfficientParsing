Hundreds of Iraqis gathered Friday in a Christian church in Baghdad to mark 40
days since al-Qaida militants carried out a deadly October siege there.

Christians at the badly damaged Our Lady of Salvation (Sayidat al-Nejat) church
remembered the 46 worshippers who died in the October 31 attack.

Witnesses say militants entered the church firing guns and immediately killed
one of the priests at point-blank range.  The militants then held more than 100
worshippers as hostages until Iraqi forces stormed the church and ended the
siege.

The families of victims and survivors were among those who attended Friday's
mass.

As many as 1.2 million Christians lived in Iraq before the 2003 invasion to
oust leader Saddam Hussein.  However, many have since fled abroad in the wake
of stepped-up violence by al-Qaida-linked Muslim insurgents.
