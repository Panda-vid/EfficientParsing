Marc Anthony has agreed to pay approximately $2.5 million in back taxes, after
failing to file income tax returns for five years.
Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said the Latin music singer, who
is married to singer-actress Jennifer Lopez, failed to file returns from 2000
through 2004 on $15.5 million in income. Morgenthau said he did file for 2005.
Marc Anthony - born Marco Antonio Muniz - signed the payment agreement April 3.
Morgenthau said his office did not prosecute the 38-year-old singer because he
was apparently unaware of errors on the part of the professional accountant who
prepared his tax returns.
