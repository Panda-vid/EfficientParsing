Former world number one women's tennis player Martina Hingis has lost in the
semifinals of the Australian women's hard court tournament in Gold Coast,
falling to fourth seeded Italian Plavia Pennetta 1-6, 7-6, 6-2.
The loss Friday ended Hingis' three match winning streak in her first
tournament since injuries forced the Swiss tennis player into retirement three
years ago.
She also announced after the match that she would not play in a scheduled
semifinal doubles match later Friday because of a hip injury. Hingis still
intends to play in the Sydney International Tournament next week and the
Australian open which begins January 16.
In the other semifinal match Friday, the Czech Republic's Lucie Safarova
defeated third-seeded Dinara Safina of Russia, 6-4, 6-2.
