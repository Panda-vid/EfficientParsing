The U.S. Energy Department says oil supplies fell by 800,000 barrels last week,
as prices continue to climb toward $100 a barrel.
Crude oil prices rose above $98 a barrel during trading in New York Wednesday
as the dollar weakened and investors anticipated the drop in U.S. stockpiles.
Industry experts say it is inevitable that oil will reach the $100 mark.
Investors have been buying oil to counter the risks of inflation posed by the
weak dollar.Â  As the dollar declines in value, oil becomes cheaper for foreign
investors.
A report from the International Energy Agency, IAEA, Wednesday says oil costs
will continue to rise through the year 2030, as demand rises, particularly in
China and India.
