A published report says the Bush administration is considering plans for
permanently imprisoning some suspected terrorists held by the U.S. military and
Central Intelligence Agency.
The Washington PostÂ Sunday quotes unidentified U.S. officials as saying the
White House is considering a plan to indefinitely hold certain detainees the
administration does not want released or turned over to courts in the United
States or other countries. In some cases, the reason is said to be a lack of
evidence.
The newspaper says Washington is considering transferring large numbers of
prisoners from Afghanistan, Yemen and Saudi Arabia held at the U.S. military
prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to U.S.-built prisons in their homelands.
International human rights groups have criticized the Bush administration for
indefinitely detaining people without charges or allowing them access to legal
counsel.
