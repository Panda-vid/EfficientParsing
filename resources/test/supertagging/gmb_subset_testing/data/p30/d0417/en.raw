Pakistani police have used batons to break up a protest march by survivors of
the October 8 earthquake protesting their eviction from a makeshift camp in
Pakistani Kashmir.
Officials say the violence erupted Friday as some 200 people marched through
the streets of Muzaffarabad. Police blocked their way, then began dispersing
the crowd with batons, rifle butts and canes.
Several people were reported injured. Police made a number of arrests.
Officials say quake survivors had been asked to leave the informal camps set up
throughout the city because the facilities lacked adequate sanitation and posed
a public health risk.
International organizations say the 7.6 magnitude earthquake killed at least
86,000 Pakistanis and made some three million homeless. More than 1,300 people
were killed in Indian Kashmir.
