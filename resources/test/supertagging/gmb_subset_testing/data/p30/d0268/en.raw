The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran appears to have
suspended its uranium-enrichment activities, as it had promised.
Mohamed ElBaradei told reportersÂ Monday, at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, he
thinks "pretty much everything has come to a halt" at Iran's nuclear
laboratories, but that the U.N. agency will need a few days to verify Tehran's
compliance.
Mr. ElBaradei says the IAEA should have a definite answer about Iran's uranium-
enrichment work by Thursday. The enrichment process can be used to produce
either nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes (such as reactors to generate
electricity) or weapons-grade uranium suitable for warheads.
The United States contends Iran is engaged in a secret plan to build nuclear
weapons. Last week, President Bush said he has seen evidence that Iran was
trying to accelerate its military program ahead of today's deadline.
