China has ruled out holding a meeting with senior leaders from Japan and South
Korea during an upcoming Asian economic meeting in Malaysia.
The three nations have met on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations summit for the past six years.
China's foreign ministry spokesman said the three-way meeting would not take
place due to reasons he described as "known to all." That was an apparent
reference to China's objections to Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's
repeated visits to a controversial war shrine.
The Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo honors Japan's war dead, including those guilty of
criminal acts during World War II.
Critics say the shrine glorifies Japan's wartime past, but Mr. Koizumi says he
visits the shrine to pray for peace.
