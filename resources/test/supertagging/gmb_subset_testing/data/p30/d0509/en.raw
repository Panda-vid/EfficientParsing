A Pakistani immigrant has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for helping an
al-Qaida operative gain entrance to the United States.
Uzair Paracha had been convicted last November of posing as former U.S.
resident Majid Khan, in order to obtain documents so the al-Qaida operative
could slip back into the United States.
Prosecutors said Khan plotted to bomb underground gasoline storage tanks in the
eastern U.S. state of Maryland in 2003.Â  Khan never arrived in the country and
the plot was never carried out.
Paracha's lawyers told the court that he had been duped into participating in
the plot, and that his statements to investigators had occurred under pressure.
The judge in the case said Paracha was fully aware that he was dealing with al-
Qaida when he agreed to help Khan.
