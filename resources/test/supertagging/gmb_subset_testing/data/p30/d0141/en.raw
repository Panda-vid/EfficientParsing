During his two-day stay, Hu Jintao's talks with British Prime Minister Tony
Blair are expected to touch on a range of issues, including economic relations
and global warming.
Mr. Hu also is expected to discuss Beijing's push for an end to a 16-year
European Union arms embargo against China. The ban was imposed after China's
brutal crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests.
The Chinese president also will attend a banquet with Queen Elizabeth II.
Following his visit to Britain, Mr. Hu is to travel to Germany and Spain before
heading to South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum that
begins November 18.
