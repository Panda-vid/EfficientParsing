The British and Irish prime ministers say much has been achieved in the
Northern Ireland peace process but an accord on restoring the province's power-
sharing government is not yet complete.
Britain's Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, spoke in Belfast
Wednesday, their latest deadline for agreement. The two men insisted a deal on
the issue is very close and reaffirmed their commitment to continue efforts for
an accord.
The Irish Republican Army said Tuesday it turned down a demand by hard-line
Protestants that it provide photographic evidence of its disarmament.  The head
of the IRA's political wing says that to do so would mean public humiliation. 
Negotiators are trying to revive a power-sharing administration established
under the 1998 Good Friday peace accord.
Britain suspended the Northern Ireland government two years ago, amid charges
of IRA spying on provincial officials.
