Afghan officials say at least 10 civilians were killed Friday when a barrage of
rockets targeting a U.S. military base in eastern Afghanistan hit a nearby
village.
Several others were wounded in the attack in Kunar province believed to be the
work of Taleban militants.
Hours earlier, a suicide bomber blew up a car packed with explosives near an
entrance to the Kabul International Airport, killing two Afghan soldiers and
wounding about 10 others.
The bomber rammed the car into a NATO vehicle but the explosives did not go off
immediately. The car sped off and then exploded, hitting a group of Afghan
soldiers waiting to fly to Italy for military training.
The Taleban claimed responsibility for the attack.
The past 19 months in Afghanistan have been marked by a steady rise in militant
attacks, marking the bloodiest period since the Taleban was ousted from power
by U.S. troops in 2001.
