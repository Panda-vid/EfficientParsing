Ukraine's parliament has voted to dismiss Prime Minister Yuri Yekhanurov's
government over a gas deal with Russia.
Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko told reporters in Astana, Kazakhstan that
the vote was unconstitutional. He said he will elaborate on the matter after
consulting with his lawyers. Even if he is dismissed, Mr. Yekhanurov will
remain acting prime minister until a new cabinet is named.
Ukraine's Justice Minister, Serhiy Holovaty says a new cabinet can only be
formed after parliamentary elections in March.
The vote followed criticism of a deal reached last Wednesday under which
Ukraine would pay $95 for 1,000 cubic meters of Russian gas. The price is
double what Ukraine had been paying.
Ukraine's former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko last week announced plans for
court action to challenge the agreement. She said she would seek charges of
betrayal of national interests and exceeding authority.
