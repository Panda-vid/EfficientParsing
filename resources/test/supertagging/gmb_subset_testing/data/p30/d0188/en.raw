U.S. soldiers in Iraq have discovered a large cache of weapons and ammunition
during a random house-to-house search in Baghdad.
U.S. military officials say the soldiers also detained five suspected
terrorists in Monday's operation in the Al Rashid district of the capital.
Rocket launchers, mortars, AK-47 rifles, explosives and 300 rounds of
ammunition, along with several Iraqi police uniforms were among the items
seized from the house.
Meanwhile, Iraqi and Egyptian official say there has been no contact from the
assailants who abducted Egypt's top envoy to Iraq.
Officials say the envoy, Ihab al-Sherif, was kidnapped Saturday near his home
in Baghdad as he stopped to buy a newspaper.
His abduction follows Cairo's announcement that Egypt would become the first
Arab nation to establish full diplomatic ties with Iraq's new government.
