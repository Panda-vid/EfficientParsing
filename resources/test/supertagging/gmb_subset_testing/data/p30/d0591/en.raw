The Washington Post newspaper reports Wednesday that the U.S. government
database of alleged international terrorism suspects and their associates now
contains 325,000 names. 
The paper says the list has quadrupled in size since it was created in 2003.
The list is maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center. Civil liberties
advocates say they are concerned that innocent people may be on the list.
Counterterrorism center officials say the actual number of people on the list
is approximately 200,000, because the same person may appear under different
spellings or aliases.  An administration official told the Post that U.S.
citizens make up only a small fraction of the names.
The newspaper report says the database is a compilation of reports supplied by
the CIA, FBI, and other agencies.
