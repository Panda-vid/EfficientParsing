A Danish court has dismissed a legal case filed by citizens who accused Prime
Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen of violating the country's constitution by
sending troops to Iraq.
The group, including the family of a Danish soldier killed in Iraq, had brought
suit against the prime minister.
The suit accused him of violating the constitution because he dispatched the
troops in the absence of a United Nations resolution authorizing the Iraqi
operation.
The plaintiffs have indicated readiness to appeal to Denmark's Supreme Court.
Denmark has fewer than 500 troops serving in southern Iraq. Mr. Rasmussen has
announced plans to withdraw them later this year and replace them with four
helicopters and an air force unit of about 50.
