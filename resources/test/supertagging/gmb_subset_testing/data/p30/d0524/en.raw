India's prime minister has met with top nuclear scientists to discuss their
objections to changes proposed by US lawmakers in the civilian nuclear
agreement reached last year between New Delhi and Washington.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met with the group of eight scientists Wednesday
after they had urged India's parliament to reject the changes. They said in an
open letter earlier this week that the proposed modifications would place
restraints on India's nuclear options.
Mr. Singh is scheduled to speak to the upper house of parliament Thursday and
is expected to reassure it that the government will not accept any changes to
last year's deal.
The U.S. House of Representatives approved the changes in India-US civilian
nuclear agreement in July. The U.S. Senate is expected to vote on it next
month.
