Seven South American countries are launching a new development bank aimed at
expanding regional trade and growth.
The Banco del Sur, or Bank of the South, is to be officially established on
November third in Caracas, Venezuela. The date was agreed on by regional
finance ministers meeting in Brazil Monday.
The bank, championed by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, is also supported by
Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and Ecuador. The presidents of
each country must sign off on the deal before the bank can get underway.
Mr. Chavez proposed the regional bank as part of a drive to counter the
conditional lending practices of international institutions such as the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund.
Officials say the bank will be open to all South American countries.
