The U.S. military says American Marines accused of killing 19 Afghan civilians
while responding to an ambush last year acted in accordance with military
rules.
Military officials said Friday the commander of Marine Corps forces (Central
Command) decided not to bring criminal charges against officers involved in the
March 2007 operation.
Officials said Lieutenant General Samuel Helland determined the officers acted
"appropriately" after coming under attack in Afghanistan's eastern Nangarhar
province.
The military has called the incident a "complex attack," in which a suicide car
bomber rammed a U.S. convoy before other militants opened fire, sparking a gun
battle.
Afghan witnesses and police have said U.S. troops fired on civilians, killing
up to 19 people and wounding several others. U.S. officials have said it is not
clear whether the civilians were killed by American troops or the militants.
