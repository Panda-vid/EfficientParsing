At least six people, including a U.S. soldier, have died in roadside bombs and
shootings Saturday in Iraq.
In a town 80 kilometers south of Baghdad, gunmen abducted a policeman and his
brother and shot them.  Also south of Baghdad, insurgents attacked an Iraqi
army convoy, killing two soldiers.
In western Baghdad, a roadside bomb killed an Iraqi policeman and wounded two
others.
The U.S. military said an American soldier died when a roadside bomb hit his
convoy southwest of Baghdad.
The bodies of at least six men, apparently killed execution-style, were found
in the capital.
The violence comes as Iraqi leaders continue their efforts to form a new
cabinet.  Washington says a national unity government will help stem the
violence.
This month, about 70 U.S. soldiers have died in Iraq, making it the deadliest
month for US troops this year.
