The Hollywood movie studio that produced well-known films like the James Bond
series and "The Wizard of Oz" has filed for bankruptcy.

For decades, MGM has been making films that begin with the distinctive picture
and sound of a lion roaring.

The studio is to be restructured and given new leadership, but it will continue
making movies. Executives from a rival film company, Spyglass Entertainment,
will now run MGM.

The creditors included billionaire Carl Icahn, who was pressing for a different
company to take over the failing studio. After lengthy negotiations, the
creditors agreed to exchange about $4 billion in debt for shares in the new
company.

The studio was hurt by some expensive films that sold too few tickets to make a
profit, slumping sales of DVDs, and a heavy debt burden.
