%%% French President Jacques Chirac says his top priority is ending the two-week-old wave of urban unrest , as he pledged to address the root causes of the violence The French leader told a Paris news conference Thursday the government will have to respond to problems in largely Muslim-inhabited working class suburbs , which have experienced most of the rioting . The violence has involved youths of immigrant background who have complained of police harassment , racism and job discrimination . The violence began October 27 after the accidental deaths of two teenagers of North African descent who thought they were being chased by police . Police Thursday reported fewer violent incidents in France 's metropolitan centers . Authorities also said they have suspended eight police officers pending investigation into Monday 's beating of a young man in a northern suburb of Paris during the disturbances .
