Meterologists say a new tropical storm has formed off the east coast of Florida
but do not expect the storm to become a hurricane.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center says Tropical Storm Tammy is centered about
32 kilometers east of Cape Canaveral, home of the United States' space shuttle
fleet.
The storm is expected to move up the East Coast and dump heavy rain on the
states of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. But forecasters say Tammy will
likely spend only a short time over water, preventing it from gaining hurricane
strength.
Tammy is the 19th named storm of this year's unusually active Atlantic
hurricane season.
The 18th storm of the season, Tropical Storm Stan, is dissipating after passing
over the mountains of southeastern Mexico.
