Jamaica's prime minister has announced plans for a huge economic stimulus
package to stave off some of the side effects of the global financial slowdown.


In a televised broadcast Sunday night, Bruce Golding said the measures would
mostly be aimed at small businesses, manufacturing and the ailing tourism
industry.

The plan includes tax cuts and at least $6.4 million in loans for the tourism
sector to help with cash flow. Another $4.5 million will go toward small
businesses.

Mr. Golding also pledged to help workers who have lost their jobs and borrowers
who are having difficulty making their mortgage payments.

Mr. Golding said the moves would help weather the crisis, but that further re-
structuring would be needed to make Jamaica more business and investment
friendly.
