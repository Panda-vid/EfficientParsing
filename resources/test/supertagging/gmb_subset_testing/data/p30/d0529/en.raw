Iraq's parliament is due to hold a special session Sunday to try to resolve
political disputes delaying the passage of a provincial elections law.

Parliamentary speaker Mahmoud al-Mashhadani says a special session is needed to
debate the measure because the assembly went into summer recess Wednesday.

Iraq's government had hoped to hold provincial elections in October, but
disagreements between Iraqi factions about electoral guidelines mean the vote
may be delayed until next year.

Iraqi Kurdish lawmakers have rejected proposals to share provincial council
seats in Kirkuk equally among the region's ethnic groups. Iraqi Kurds and their
allies currently hold the majority in Kirkuk's assembly.

Hundreds of Iraqi Kurds protested in the northern city of Sulaimaniya Wednesday
against the proposal for power-sharing in Kirkuk. A similar protest in the city
of Irbil on Tuesday drew thousands of people.
