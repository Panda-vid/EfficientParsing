Pakistani security forces say they have arrested a senior Taleban figure in
northwestern Pakistan, near the Afghan border.
Pakistani Interior Minister Aftab Khan Sherpao says the head of the ousted
Taleban's Culture and Information Council, Maulvi Muhammad Yasir, was arrested
last week and is being interrogated. He did not elaborate.
In another development, Muslim cleric Muhammad Adil Khan accused of having
terror links and his son, Muhammad Hassan Adil, have arrived in Pakistan after
being deported from the United States.
Pakistani officials say the two were detained upon their arrival in the city of
Lahore and are being questioned by authorities.
They are part of a group of five men arrested in June as part of an FBI probe
into alleged terror activities involving the Islamic community in Lodi,
California.
