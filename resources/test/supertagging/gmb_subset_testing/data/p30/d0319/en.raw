Former Maoist rebels attacked vehicles, forced shops to close and blocked
highways Sunday in Nepal to enforce a general strike called to protest the
president.
Maoists in Nepal began a three-day strike Sunday, forcing the closure of shops
and businesses, and blocking roads and highways.

The former rebels are protesting what they call the unconstitutional actions of
Nepal's president in overturning their decision to fire the head of the army.

The protest has been largely peaceful, although police say some vehicles have
been vandalized, and some protesters have been arrested.

Tensions have been high in Nepal since a Maoist-led government resigned in May
amid a dispute with President Ram Baran Yadav concerning the army chief.  The
former rebels have since led a series of protests.

Maoists ended a decade-long civil war in 2006 to join a peace process.  They
won a majority of seats in parliament in elections last year.
