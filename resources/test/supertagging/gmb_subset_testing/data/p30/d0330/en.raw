A spokesman for Indonesia's navy says five of its warships have left a disputed
area in the Sulawesi Sea ahead of talks Wednesday with Malaysia.
Indonesian Foreign Minister Hasan Wirayuda is to meet with his Malaysian
counterpart, Syed Hamid Albar, in Jakarta to discuss competing claims in the
oil and gas-rich area. Both countries have vowed to solve the matter
diplomatically.
The dispute escalated in February when Malaysia awarded exploration contracts
to Royal Dutch/Shell. Indonesia responded by deploying seven warships and four
F-16 fighter jets in the area.
The issue has further strained relations between the two countries. Indonesians
are also angry about Kuala Lumpur's recent crackdown on several hundred
thousand illegal migrant workers from Indonesia.
