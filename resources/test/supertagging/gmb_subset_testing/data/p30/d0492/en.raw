Colombian leftist rebels have attacked a local military post with homemade
rockets, killing 14 marines and wounding 25 others.
Navy officials say members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, carried out the attack in the southwestern county of Iscuande.
The Associated Press reports some of the troops were natives of the area and
were receiving military training.
Colombia is mired in a long-running conflict involving leftist rebels, rightist
paramilitaries and the government. The violence leaves thousands dead each
year.
Since 2000, the United States has provided Colombia with about three million
dollars in mostly military aid to combat the rebels and drug production.
