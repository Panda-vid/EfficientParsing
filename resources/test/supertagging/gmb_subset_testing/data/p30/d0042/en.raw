Two U.S. astronauts from the space shuttle Discoveryhave completed a third
spacewalk to make external repairs on the International Space Station.
Michael Fossum and Ronald Garan spent more than six hours Sunday outside the
orbiting laboratory, where they replaced a nitrogen tank used to cool the
station.
They also inspected a problematic joint attached to the station's solar power
panels. The astronauts collected samples of debris from the joint for analysis
on Earth. This was the astronauts' final spacewalk of the 14-day shuttle
mission.
The Discoveryarrived at the station last week to install a new Japanese
laboratory named Kibo.
On Saturday, Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda spoke to Japanese astronaut
Akihiko Hoshide through a video link to congratulate the team on its work.
Hoshide and the other astronauts tested the Kibo's robotic arm for the first
time on Saturday.
Kibo is Japanese for "hope."
