The U.S. military is denying reports that Pakistani soldiers fired at two U.S.
helicopters for allegedly violating Pakistani airspace.

Lieutenant Nathan Perry Monday told VOA that U.S. helicopters did not enter
Pakistan and that there was no operation going on in the border area that would
cross into Pakistan.

Local officials in Pakistan's northern tribal region said the incident happened
late Sunday when the helicopters crossed into Pakistan's North Waziristan
district.

The Pakistani army has so far not commented on the alleged incident.

Last week, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said his government will not
tolerate violations of Pakistan's sovereignty by any power in the name of
combating terrorism.

His comments were made after a series of suspected U.S. missile strikes and a
ground attack against militant targets in Pakistan. Â
