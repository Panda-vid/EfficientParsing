Ethiopia says it has accepted "in principle" an independent commission's ruling
on its border with former foe Eritrea.
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi told parliament members Thursday the
government has accepted the ruling in the best interests of the country.
Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a 2.5-year border war between May 1998 and December
2000 in which tens of thousands of people were killed.
As part of a deal to end the war, the two nations agreed to form an independent
boundary commission and that its decision would be final and binding. Eritrea
accepted the April 2000 decision but Ethiopia said it disagreed with some
aspects of its findings.
