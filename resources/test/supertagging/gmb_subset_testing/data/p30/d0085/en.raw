World leaders attending a conference on Islam's global roles are calling on
Muslim clerics and scholars to do more to denounce terrorism and its
masterminds.
The gathering in Vienna of religious and political leaders is examining ways to
improve contacts between the West and Muslim nations.
Iraqi President Jalal Talabani told the gathering that if terrorism is not
denounced it might allow Islamic radicalism to spread.  He said Islamic leaders
must declare that terrorist groups are only trying to deceive their followers
and do nothing but create destruction.
Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned that failure to defeat Taleban-led
terrorism in his country could have wider consequences, and predicted more
attacks to come.  But he vowed they will not stop him from democratizing the
country and further strengthening the democratic institutions.
