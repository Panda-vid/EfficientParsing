A major battle is shaping up in the U.S. Senate, with Democratic majority
leader Harry Reid accusing congressional Republicans of abusing power for their
own political good.
Speaking in his party's weekly radio address Saturday, Senator Reid of Nevada
said plans by Republican leaders to ban the use of filibusters threatens the
checks-and-balances system devised by the nation's founding fathers.
He said stripping away the power of senators to use extended debate to stall or
reject presidential judicial nominees would simply make the U.S. Senate a
rubber stamp for the White House.
Mr. Reid has previously threatened to retaliate by bringing Senate business to
a virtual halt if the Republican plan, called the nuclear option, is enacted.
