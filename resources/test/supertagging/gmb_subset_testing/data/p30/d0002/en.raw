Afghan election officials say they plan to increase the number of voting
stations for next week's presidential runoff election, despite concerns that
could lead to more fraud than in the first vote.

Afghanistan's independent election commission says it will slightly increase
the number of polling centers to 6,322 and have enough staff to ensure a
credible process.

Foreign election observers had recommended reducing the more than 6,000 polling
centers used in the first round after auditors found more than one million
fraudulent votes.

Many fake ballots are believed to have come from remote polling stations that
never opened or did not have observers monitoring the vote.

Meanwhile, the Taliban in Afghanistan has vowed to intensify its attacks
leading up to the November 7 election.Â  A Taliban spokesman told the French
news agency the militant group has new plans and tactics to disrupt the
election.

The United Nations has not responded to the Afghan announcement of an increase
in polling centers. On Wednesday, U.N. officials said workers will continue to
help the country prepare for the vote, despite a deadly Taliban attack on a
Kabul guesthouse that killed five U.N. staff members.

The Taliban said the attack Wednesday was the first step of a plan aimed at
disrupting the vote, in which incumbent President Hamid Karzai is facing off
against former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah.
