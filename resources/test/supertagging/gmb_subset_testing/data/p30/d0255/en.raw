Energy officials in Georgia say strong winds and heavy snow have downed power
lines in the western part of the country, cutting power to millions of
citizens.
Deputy Energy Minister Alexander Khetaguri told the Associated Press Thursday
fierce weather ruptured power lines leading from the Inguri hydroelectric
station to eastern regions, leaving about three million people in the dark.
He said most of the capital, Tbilisi, was also without electricity today after
a unit at a power station malfunctioned.
The small former Soviet country is already battling freezing winter
temperatures with limited supplies of natural gas after two explosions Sunday
hit a pipeline in Russia carrying supplies to Georgia.
